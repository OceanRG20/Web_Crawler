3) Normalized categories ONLY if explicitly stated on the site:
   - CNC Mills (3-axis)
   - CNC Mills (5-axis)
   - Wire EDM
   - Sinker EDM
   - Hole-Popper EDM
   - Gun Drill
   - Injection Molding Tryout Presses
   - CMM / Metrology Systems

ALWAYS extract Yasda, Makino, and Kern machines when visible.

DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Generic phrases (“CNC machining”, “precision machining”, “state-of-the-art equipment”)
- Software, automation, robots, grinders, or hand tools

If no valid equipment evidence exists:
Equipment: null

Source:
- Write the provided source name exactly as given after “Source:”.
- If none provided:
Source: Not Sure
