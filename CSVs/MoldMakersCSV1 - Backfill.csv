Column_ID,GPT_Prompt,Result
Number of employees,"You are updating ONLY the ""Number of employees"" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Existing Number of employees cell (may be blank)
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank)
- Any other descriptive fields (industries, products, about text, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the ""Number of employees"" cell for THIS row, following these rules exactly:

====================================================
PRIORITY ORDER (MANDATORY)
1) Site-based value (highest accuracy)
2) Calculated value (medium accuracy)
3) Public / 3rd-party estimate (least accurate)
Always output values in this exact order.
====================================================

1) START WITH EXISTING SITE VALUE 
- If the cell already contains a site-derived value, keep it and tag with ""(site)"" if not already tagged. 
- Example: ""50"" ? ""50 (site)""

2) ADD CALCULATED EMPLOYEE COUNT (IF NEEDED) 
- Use ONLY when:
• no site value exists, OR 
• the calculated value adds meaningful clarity. 
- Calculation formula: 
employees ˜ revenue_dollars ÷ 200,000 
- Round to the nearest whole number. 
- Tag as ""(calc from revenue_site)"". 
- This MUST appear **after site values** and **before public estimates**.

3) ADD PUBLIC / 3RD-PARTY EMPLOYEE ESTIMATE 
- If you can infer a plausible public estimate (ZoomInfo-type data), tag as: 
""~40 (public: BF 2024)"" 
- Public estimates must always appear LAST.

4) COMBINING VALUES 
- Separate each value with ""; "" 
- Required output order: 
1) site 
2) calc 
3) public 
- Example final outputs: 
""50 (site); 69 (calc from revenue_site)"" 
""50 (site); ~70 (public: BF 2024)"" 
""50 (site); 69 (calc from revenue_site); ~70 (public: BF 2024)"" 
""69 (calc from revenue_site)"" 
""69 (calc from revenue_site); ~70 (public: BF 2024)""

5) WHEN NOTHING CAN BE DETERMINED 
- If no site, no calc, and no public signals exist ? output """" (blank).

Return ONLY the final Number of employees cell value.

Estimated Revenues,"You are updating ONLY the ""Estimated Revenues"" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank or partially filled)
- Number of employees cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Facility square footage cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Other descriptive fields (about text, industries, products, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the ""Estimated Revenues"" cell for THIS row.

====================================================
MANDATORY PRIORITY ORDER FOR FINAL OUTPUT
1) Site-based revenue (highest credibility)
2) Calculated revenue (medium credibility)
3) Public / third-party estimates (lowest credibility)

Values must ALWAYS appear in this exact order in the final cell.
====================================================

STEP 1 — START WITH EXISTING DATA 
- Preserve any valid site-based value and tag it as ""(site)"". 
- If multiple site values exist, keep them first in the output.

STEP 2 — NEWS-BASED VALUES (IF ANY) 
- If confident revenue appears in news/press ? treat as equivalent to site accuracy. 
- Tag as ""(news YYYY)"" and place BEFORE site values.

FINAL ORDER SO FAR:
1) News 
2) Site 

STEP 3 — CALCULATED REVENUE (EMPLOYEES ? REVENUE) 
- Use ONLY when needed (no strong site/news value OR adds clarity). 
- Formula: 
revenue ˜ employees × 200,000 
- Round to clean values (e.g., ""$12M""). 
- Tag: ""(calc from employees)"" 
- This MUST appear AFTER site/news and BEFORE public estimates.

STEP 4 — CALCULATED REVENUE (SQFT ? REVENUE) 
- Use ONLY when: 
• no usable employee count exists, AND 
• square footage is available. 
- Formula: 
revenue ˜ sqft × 600 
- Tag: ""(calc from sqft)"" 
- Also placed BEFORE public estimates.

STEP 5 — PUBLIC DIRECTORY ESTIMATES 
- ZoomInfo/D&B/etc. 
- Tag: ""(public: ZI 2023)"" or ""(public: BF 2024)"" 
- These ALWAYS appear LAST.

====================================================
FINAL OUTPUT ORDER EXAMPLES
====================================================
""$14M (news 2023); $13.8M (site); $12M (calc from employees); ~$5–10M (public: ZI 2023)""
""~$8M (site); ~$12M (calc from employees)""
""$12M (calc from employees); ~$5–10M (public: ZI 2023)""
""$8–15M (public: BF 2024)"" (if only public data exists)
""$11M (calc from sqft)"" (if only sqft calc is possible)
""NI"" (if no data at all)

====================================================
If absolutely NO revenue information can be inferred, return exactly:
NI

Return only ONE cell string.

Square footage (facility),"You are updating ONLY the ""Square footage (facility)"" cell for one company in the MMCrawl sheet.

You will be given the FULL MMCrawl row, including:
- The current Square footage (facility) cell (may contain site info, public info, calculations, or be blank)
- Estimated Revenues and Number of employees (may be blank)
- All descriptive fields (About, Services, Equipment, Industries, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the ""Square footage (facility)"" cell for THIS row.

=====================================================
RULE 0 — NEVER CHANGE THE MEANING
=====================================================
• Never delete an existing numeric datapoint.
• Never invent a new numeric value that is not supported by site text, public sources, or the revenue formula below.
• You MAY normalize wording/formatting (add “ft²”, change ""(estimate)"" to ""(zoominfo)"", fix spacing, standardize separators), but the underlying numbers and provenance must stay the same.

=====================================================
RULE 1 — MAXIMUM TWO ITEMS PER CELL
=====================================================
The final cell may contain:
- Up to TWO numeric items (e.g. a site value and a public value, or a site value and a calc-from-revenue value), OR
- A single token ""NI"", OR
- A single token ""refer to site"".

When more than two numeric items are available, keep at most TWO according to this priority:
1) Site value (highest priority)
2) Public value
3) Calc-from-revenue value (lowest priority)

Examples of allowed combinations:
- ""23,000 ft² (site); 30,000 ft² (public: BF 2024)""
- ""40,000 ft² (site); 55,000 ft² (calc from revenue)""
- ""~30k ft² (public: ZI 2023)""
- ""18,333 ft² (calc from revenue)""
- ""NI""
- ""refer to site""

Disallowed (do NOT output):
- Three or more numeric items separated by semicolons.

=====================================================
2) START FROM THE EXISTING CELL (NORMALIZE IF NEEDED)
=====================================================
Let “baseline” be the current Square footage (facility) value (may be empty).

If baseline is NOT empty:
- Preserve all numeric datapoints and their tags.
- You may clean up formatting:
• Ensure each numeric item includes “ft²” somewhere.
• Normalize ""(estimate)"" ? ""(zoominfo)"" when it clearly refers to a ZoomInfo-type estimate.
• Standardize separators as: ""<value 1>; <value 2>"" (semicolon + single space).
- Identify which items are:
• site items ? tagged ""(site)""
• public items ? tagged ""(public: ...)""
• calc items ? tagged ""(calc from revenue)"" or obviously equivalent.
- If there are more than two numeric items, keep at most TWO according to the priority:
1) keep the best site item
2) keep the best public item (if present)
3) otherwise, if needed to reach two items, keep ONE calc-from-revenue item
Discard any additional, lower-priority items when there would be more than two in total.

If baseline is empty:
- You will construct the value from rules 3–5.

=====================================================
3) ADD SITE VALUE IF MISSING
=====================================================
Look for facility size in the row text (About, Services, etc.), e.g.:
- “our 45,000 sq ft facility”
- “a 30,000-square-foot plant”
- “20k ft2 shop”

If you find a clear site facility size AND there is no ""(site)"" item in baseline AND you still have fewer than two total numeric items:
- Extract and normalize it, e.g. ""45,000 ft² (site)"" or ""~30k ft² (site)"".
- Add it to the value (respecting the max-two-items rule).

=====================================================
4) ADD PUBLIC VALUE IF MISSING
=====================================================
If you can find a credible public estimate for facility size (e.g., BF, ZoomInfo, trade press) AND there is no ""(public: ...)"" item AND you still have fewer than two total numeric items:
- Add a new item such as:
""~30k ft² (public: BF 2024)""
""~25k ft² (public: ZI 2023)""

=====================================================
5) LAST-RESORT CALCULATION FROM REVENUE
=====================================================
Only perform a revenue-based square footage calculation when ALL of the following are true:
1) There is NO ""(site)"" item.
2) There is NO ""(public: ...)"" item.
3) Estimated Revenues is available and roughly credible.
4) You still have fewer than two numeric items.

Then:
- Approximate square_footage ˜ Revenue ÷ 600
- Express as:
""18,333 ft² (calc from revenue)""
or ""~18k ft² (calc from revenue)""

=====================================================
6) WHEN TO RETURN ""NI"" OR ""REFER TO SITE""
=====================================================
After applying all steps:

• If you still have ZERO numeric items and there is NO convincing evidence anywhere in the row that the facility size exists or is discussed ? return ""NI"".

• If you still have ZERO numeric items but the row clearly talks about the plant / facility in a way that suggests a size is known but not stated (e.g., “our large multi-building facility”, “multi-plant campus”) ? return ""refer to site"".

• If you have one or two numeric items ? return those items only (no ""NI"" or ""refer to site"" in combination with numbers).

=====================================================
7) OUTPUT FORMAT
=====================================================
• Output ONE final line only.
• Use ""ft²"" for square feet.
• Separate multiple items with ""; "" (semicolon + single space).
• Do NOT output more than TWO numeric items.
• No commentary or explanation; ONLY the final cell value.

Years of operation,"You are updating ONLY the ""Years of operation"" column in a sheet called MMCrawl. 

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including: 
- Company Name 
- Public Website Homepage URL (company site URL) 
- Years of operation cell (may be blank or already filled) 
- Founding year or history notes (if any) 
- Any other descriptive fields (about text, industries, products, ownership, etc.) 

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the ""Years of operation"" cell for THIS row, following these rules exactly: 

1) Respect existing values 
- If the ""Years of operation"" cell in this row is ALREADY filled with a non-empty value, simply return that existing value unchanged. 
- Only try to calculate or estimate years of operation when the cell is currently blank. 

2) What ""Years of operation"" means 
- ""Years of operation"" is the number of years the company has been operating (age of the company). 
- If you see a statement like ""founded in 1971"", convert that into an approximate years-of-operation figure. 
- Use a reasonable current year (for example, 2024–2025) when doing the subtraction. You do NOT need to state the founding year in the cell, only the years of operation. 

3) Use the website URL as the primary source 
- Focus first on the company’s own website (Public Website Homepage URL). 
- Use any clues from the row or from that site such as: 
• “Founded in 1966” 
• “Serving customers for over 30 years” 
• “Celebrating 50 years in business” 
- Convert such statements into a concise numeric or approximate years-of-operation value, e.g.: 
• ""59"" (if founded ~1966 and assuming current year ~2025) 
• ""30+"" (if the wording says “over 30 years” but not exact) 

4) If no clear years-of-operation can be derived 
- If the row and company website do NOT provide enough information to confidently estimate years of operation, return exactly: 
NI 

5) Output format 
- Return ONLY the final value for the cell: 
• Either a concise numeric-style value like ""35"", ""30+"", ""50+"", etc. 
• Or ""NI"" if nothing reliable can be determined. 
- Do NOT add words like ""years"", ""years in business"", ""founded"", or any extra commentary.

Family business,"
You are updating ONLY the ""Family business"" column in MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Ownership column (may describe ownership structure, history, individuals, etc.)
- Family business column (may be blank, ""Yes"", ""NI"", or ""refer to site"")
- Other descriptive fields (years of operation, notes, etc.)

Your job is to decide what the value of the ""Family business"" cell should be, based ONLY on the content of the row, with special attention to the Ownership column.

Possible outputs (must be exactly one of these, case-sensitive):
- Yes
- NI
- refer to site

Rules:

1. Respect existing confirmed ""Yes"":
- If the current Family business cell already contains ""Yes"" (case-insensitive), output ""Yes"" and do NOT change it.

2. When the current Family business value is ""refer to site"":
- You must analyze the Ownership column and decide whether the company is clearly a family-owned business or not.
- Only in this case (existing value = ""refer to site"") are you allowed to change the value.

3. When Ownership clearly indicates a family business ? output ""Yes"":
- If the Ownership text clearly states or strongly implies that the company is family-owned or family-run, output ""Yes"".
- Examples of clear indicators (case-insensitive, may be part of a longer sentence):
• ""family-owned""
• ""family owned""
• ""family-run""
• ""family run""
• ""family-operated""
• ""family operated""
• ""family business""
• ""second-generation"" or ""third-generation"" (when referring to ownership)
• phrases such as ""founded by X; now operated by his son/daughter"", ""multi-generation family company"", etc.
- If multiple owners are all from the same family and the text describes this as a family company, treat it as ""Yes"".

4. When Ownership describes specific individual owners but NOT clearly as a family business ? output ""refer to site"":
- If the Ownership text names one or more individuals but does NOT use any of the family-related phrases above, treat this as ambiguous.
- Examples:
• ""Privately held; owned by John Smith""
• ""Owned by Jane Doe, President""
• ""Privately held; owned by John and Mary Smith""
- In these cases, you cannot safely classify it as a family business, so you must output ""refer to site"".

5. When Ownership gives no useful signal ? output ""NI"":
- If Ownership is blank or only contains generic phrases such as:
• ""Privately held""
• ""Privately owned""
• ""Independent company""
• ""Employee-owned"" (with no mention of family)
• other neutral descriptions with no clear family indication
- And there is no other part of the row that clearly indicates the company is family-owned,
- Then output ""NI"".

6. Safety / precedence:
- Never infer ""Yes"" based solely on common surnames or guesses.
- Only output ""Yes"" when the text clearly supports that the business is family-owned or family-run.
- Otherwise prefer ""refer to site"" (for named individual owners) or ""NI"" (for generic/unknown ownership).

Output format:
- Return exactly ONE of: ""Yes"", ""NI"", or ""refer to site"".
- Do not add explanations, quotes, or any other text.
