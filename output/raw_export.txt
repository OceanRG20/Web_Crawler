Recognizing the need for skilled trades and moldmaking in the Carolinas, the partners moved south from Michigan and Ohio and built the company using computer numerical control (CNC) as a standard.
This helped to sustain a high level of efficiency and accuracy, as well as the ability to run unattended manufacturing.
The Ameritech brand quickly became associated with quality.
In 1995, Ameritech joined a consortium of five larger manufacturing companies that recognized the need for a strong apprenticeship program, and the idea for Apprenticeship 2000 came to life.
The very heart and soul of a young, vibrant, energetic group of people became the cornerstone of growth for the company, while also providing the “toolmakers of tomorrow” the opportunity to learn the trade.
See www.apprenticeship2000.com for more information on this exciting program.
In 2000, Steve bought out his partners.
As global competition increased, lower-cost tooling became a key to survival.
In order to keep new mold builds from moving offshore, Ameritech’s management developed “lean” processes and systems, to reduce cost without sacrificing quality or engineering.
Clients respected the value that Ameritech offered, and a strong customer base allowed the company to continue to thrive.
Investment in technology, meticulous program management, and precise scheduling continued to create high quality at a competitive cost.
In 2004, the opportunity arose to purchase the assets of Pinnacle Mold in Ormond Beach, Florida.
Ameritech Die & Mold South ( www.amdiemoldsouth.com ) was born!
The management of “South” worked closely with the North Carolina facility to ensure the same quality and attention to detail was included in every endeavor.
In 2009, the company received its AS9100 B quality certification.
They also hired a military and aerospace expert, and Ameritech South diversified into another new business area.
Through each change, Ameritech Die & Mold has only grown stronger and better prepared to survive global competition.
We are confident that our business plan, financial independence and strong commitment to achieving world-class proficiencies will continue to keep us at the forefront of mold manufacturing.
If you're in need of superior manufacturing techniques, and on time deliveries, then Ameritech is the mold company that you've been searching for!

When you’re looking for a plastic injection mold maker, there are thousands of choices.
But when there’s no margin for error, there’s only one - Ameritech Die & Mold.
They strive for perfection in every mold they make.
Ameritech Die & Mold creates plastic injection molds for the largest manufacturers of airbags and automotive safety equipment in the world.
There is no margin for error with an airbag.
To save a life, an airbag must deploy in less than one-twentieth (1/20) of a second.
There are no second chances.
Airbag covers are one of the most complex injection molds to design and build.
The tear seam in an airbag cover creates some of the most challenging molding issues today.
That technology -- working with complex geometries, tight tolerances, and tremendous attention to detail -- can be put to work for you.
Ameritech builds plastic injection molds for the automotive, appliance, and consumer products industries.
They work with some of the largest manufacturers in the world.
Ameritech Die & Mold works in partnership with you.
They are proactive in the development cycle.
Everything is evaluated to the nth degree.
Looking for trouble spots, they work with customers to recommend changes.
Every mold has full periphery venting, uniform cooling, and robust part ejection.
Their top priority is the quality of your part, cycle after cycle.
"Ameritech Die & Mold builds one of the best injection molds in the business.
Their craftsmanship is outstanding.
Their molds run the first time.
I throw some pretty tough stuff at them, and they deliver.
We are thrilled to have Ameritech Die & Mold doing work for us," reports a long-time customer.
"We don’t do anything easy.
We strive for perfection in every mold.
We control processes that other shops would typically send to the bench to fix.
We machine steel to precise tolerances by minimizing cutter deflection and paying attention to chip load," says Steve Rotman, President, Ameritech Die & Mold.
Although Ameritech Die & Mold has been around since 1985, the company is young.
Apprenticeship 2000 is Ameritech’s competitive edge, knowing that they are prepared for the future.
The average employee is 31 years old with 15 years experience.
Ameritech’s culture is decidedly different and fully invested.
Automation and lights-out machining reduces your costs.
You get to market faster because over 90% of their injection molds go into production after the first sampling.
Do you need long-term production tooling?
Ameritech’s customers report twice the mold life, with half the preventive maintenance.
Ameritech Die & Mold is truly a company of excellence.

CNC EDM, including Wire Our EDM department was the beginning of our implementation of robotics.
Both the manufacturing of the electrodes and the delivery of them to the workpiece is handled robotically.
Horizontal Machining Having the option for large horizontal machining allows complete flexibility in our choice of how to machine specific jobs.
This area is a huge support for our ability to produce our own custom mold bases and plate work.

You’ve seen it many times and so have we.
Shortcuts that are made at some point during the process from design to part production.

New 27,000 square foot Summit Mold Facility, built in 2021 History OUR HISTORY
March 1997 Summit Mold began as a two-man operation in the building next door , now a 10,200 square-foot facility that houses North Idaho Precision Mold , our molding company; the current owner and another having since retired.
Having the vision of originating a mold-making company and having the drive and ambition to make that dream into reality, Summit Mold began operation in March of 1997 in scenic Northern Idaho.
From the commencement, the mission was to build high quality molds that are cost effective with aggressive lead times, and this is still true to this day.

INSPECTION CAPABILITIES DESIGN MILLING E.D.M.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT Design DESIGN
Cimatron, SolidWorks & Mastercam The foundation of our molds is built off the quality of our designs.
We consider the long-term life of the molds, taking every detail into consideration when in the design stage so there are no issues after millions of shots years later.
The collaborative effort with our customers results in the exact mold they need for their product.
Considering cycle time, ejection, draft, venting, surface finish, cavitation… we build every mold custom to our customers high standards.
After the customer approves the mold design, the tool creation begins.
CNC Machining Machining Our high-speed milling capabilities allow us to produce the tight tolerances that our customers demand.
We have 5-axis milling that creates fewer setups, which results in faster lead times for our customers.
Cutting to +/- .0001” is what we do and do well.
After cutting, we are able to inspect and verify all our dimensions on our CMM.
From hardened tool steel to graphite, we cut everything to precision.
We have robots throughout the shop feeding the mills; this allow for lights out running 365 days a year.
Our master mold builders are AMBA certified for their achievement and mastery of the trade.
Electrical Discharge Machining E.D.M.
Our sinker and wire machines have the latest technology that perform the fastest burn and cut times in the industry.
The repeatability tolerances of the machines let us manage any job with ease.
Using specially infused graphite is another way we cut down on lead times, along with the robots feeding the sinkers that require longer burn times.
We utilize wire all the way down to .004” to cut the micro-molding jobs when required.
Our EDM department is a big part of what allows us to produce the molds for the intricate parts that require the detail and accuracy.
Operations & Process Project Management To allow for the smoothest transitions prior to, during, and directly following each job, we have an incredibly detailed process in which we run our operations.

Through years of dedication and focus, Craftsman Tool and Mold Company has honed in on a process to produce long-lasting and perfect mold bases.
A raw piece of tool-grade steel enters Craftsman's climate-controlled facility, where it undergoes: Laser Calibration & Inspection Precision begins with verifying dimensions using advanced metrology systems, ensuring the steel meets strict tolerances before machining begins.
CNC Machining & Gun Drilling The steel is then shaped through multi-axis CNC processes, with gun drilling used for deep and accurate cooling channels, ejector holes, or structural cavities.
Surface Grinding To achieve flawless sealing and alignment, each component is meticulously ground for parallelism and surface flatness—often held to micron-level tolerances.
Stack Mold Configuration Depending on the project, the steel may be machined into Stack Mold, Spin Stack, or Multi-Shot bases, engineered for advanced IML or IMA applications.
Final QA & Alignment Finished mold bases go through a final inspection and alignment process, ensuring they’re production-ready for high-volume injection molding systems.
From raw metal to mission-critical mold base, each step reflects Craftsman’s commitment to dimensional accuracy, scalability, and reliability.
