Recognizing the need for skilled trades and moldmaking in the Carolinas, the partners moved south from Michigan and Ohio and built the company using computer numerical control (CNC) as a standard.
This helped to sustain a high level of efficiency and accuracy, as well as the ability to run unattended manufacturing.
The Ameritech brand quickly became associated with quality.
In 1995, Ameritech joined a consortium of five larger manufacturing companies that recognized the need for a strong apprenticeship program, and the idea for Apprenticeship 2000 came to life.
The very heart and soul of a young, vibrant, energetic group of people became the cornerstone of growth for the company, while also providing the “toolmakers of tomorrow” the opportunity to learn the trade.
See www.apprenticeship2000.com for more information on this exciting program.
In 2000, Steve bought out his partners.
As global competition increased, lower-cost tooling became a key to survival.
In order to keep new mold builds from moving offshore, Ameritech’s management developed “lean” processes and systems, to reduce cost without sacrificing quality or engineering.
Clients respected the value that Ameritech offered, and a strong customer base allowed the company to continue to thrive.
Investment in technology, meticulous program management, and precise scheduling continued to create high quality at a competitive cost.
In 2004, the opportunity arose to purchase the assets of Pinnacle Mold in Ormond Beach, Florida.
Ameritech Die & Mold South ( www.amdiemoldsouth.com ) was born!
The management of “South” worked closely with the North Carolina facility to ensure the same quality and attention to detail was included in every endeavor.
In 2009, the company received its AS9100 B quality certification.
They also hired a military and aerospace expert, and Ameritech South diversified into another new business area.
Through each change, Ameritech Die & Mold has only grown stronger and better prepared to survive global competition.
We are confident that our business plan, financial independence and strong commitment to achieving world-class proficiencies will continue to keep us at the forefront of mold manufacturing.
If you're in need of superior manufacturing techniques, and on time deliveries, then Ameritech is the mold company that you've been searching for!

When you’re looking for a plastic injection mold maker, there are thousands of choices.
But when there’s no margin for error, there’s only one - Ameritech Die & Mold.
They strive for perfection in every mold they make.
Ameritech Die & Mold creates plastic injection molds for the largest manufacturers of airbags and automotive safety equipment in the world.
There is no margin for error with an airbag.
To save a life, an airbag must deploy in less than one-twentieth (1/20) of a second.
There are no second chances.
Airbag covers are one of the most complex injection molds to design and build.
The tear seam in an airbag cover creates some of the most challenging molding issues today.
That technology -- working with complex geometries, tight tolerances, and tremendous attention to detail -- can be put to work for you.
Ameritech builds plastic injection molds for the automotive, appliance, and consumer products industries.
They work with some of the largest manufacturers in the world.
Ameritech Die & Mold works in partnership with you.
They are proactive in the development cycle.
Everything is evaluated to the nth degree.
Looking for trouble spots, they work with customers to recommend changes.
Every mold has full periphery venting, uniform cooling, and robust part ejection.
Their top priority is the quality of your part, cycle after cycle.
"Ameritech Die & Mold builds one of the best injection molds in the business.
Their craftsmanship is outstanding.
Their molds run the first time.
I throw some pretty tough stuff at them, and they deliver.
We are thrilled to have Ameritech Die & Mold doing work for us," reports a long-time customer.
"We don’t do anything easy.
We strive for perfection in every mold.
We control processes that other shops would typically send to the bench to fix.
We machine steel to precise tolerances by minimizing cutter deflection and paying attention to chip load," says Steve Rotman, President, Ameritech Die & Mold.
Although Ameritech Die & Mold has been around since 1985, the company is young.
Apprenticeship 2000 is Ameritech’s competitive edge, knowing that they are prepared for the future.
The average employee is 31 years old with 15 years experience.
Ameritech’s culture is decidedly different and fully invested.
Automation and lights-out machining reduces your costs.
You get to market faster because over 90% of their injection molds go into production after the first sampling.
Do you need long-term production tooling?
Ameritech’s customers report twice the mold life, with half the preventive maintenance.
Ameritech Die & Mold is truly a company of excellence.

Robotics allows us to maintain even higher standards of "lights out" manufacturing.
CNC EDM, including Wire Our EDM department was the beginning of our implementation of robotics.
Both the manufacturing of the electrodes and the delivery of them to the workpiece is handled robotically.
Horizontal Machining Having the option for large horizontal machining allows complete flexibility in our choice of how to machine specific jobs.
This area is a huge support for our ability to produce our own custom mold bases and plate work.

You’ve seen it many times and so have we.
Shortcuts that are made at some point during the process from design to part production.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT Design DESIGN
Cimatron, SolidWorks & Mastercam The foundation of our molds is built off the quality of our designs.
We consider the long-term life of the molds, taking every detail into consideration when in the design stage so there are no issues after millions of shots years later.
The collaborative effort with our customers results in the exact mold they need for their product.
Considering cycle time, ejection, draft, venting, surface finish, cavitation… we build every mold custom to our customers high standards.
After the customer approves the mold design, the tool creation begins.
CNC Machining Machining Our high-speed milling capabilities allow us to produce the tight tolerances that our customers demand.
We have 5-axis milling that creates fewer setups, which results in faster lead times for our customers.
Cutting to +/- .0001” is what we do and do well.
After cutting, we are able to inspect and verify all our dimensions on our CMM.
From hardened tool steel to graphite, we cut everything to precision.
We have robots throughout the shop feeding the mills; this allow for lights out running 365 days a year.

Through years of dedication and focus, Craftsman Tool and Mold Company has honed in on a process to produce long-lasting and perfect mold bases.
A raw piece of tool-grade steel enters Craftsman's climate-controlled facility, where it undergoes: Laser Calibration & Inspection Precision begins with verifying dimensions using advanced metrology systems, ensuring the steel meets strict tolerances before machining begins.
CNC Machining & Gun Drilling The steel is then shaped through multi-axis CNC processes, with gun drilling used for deep and accurate cooling channels, ejector holes, or structural cavities.
Surface Grinding To achieve flawless sealing and alignment, each component is meticulously ground for parallelism and surface flatness—often held to micron-level tolerances.
Stack Mold Configuration Depending on the project, the steel may be machined into Stack Mold, Spin Stack, or Multi-Shot bases, engineered for advanced IML or IMA applications.
Final QA & Alignment Finished mold bases go through a final inspection and alignment process, ensuring they’re production-ready for high-volume injection molding systems.
From raw metal to mission-critical mold base, each step reflects Craftsman’s commitment to dimensional accuracy, scalability, and reliability.

The Helm Tool Story - An American Dream!
In the 1960's Berlin, Helmut Mueller embarked on a unique journey, splitting his time between working at a mold and die shop by day and studying engineering at night.
It was during this period that Mueller's vision of the American dream was ignited by an unexpected source: a Sears catalog.
"I glimpsed at the catalog and saw the potential for prosperity and a higher standard of living," reflects Mueller.
Driven by this revelation, Mueller made the bold decision to relocate to the Greater Chicago Area in pursuit of opportunities in the tooling, mold, and die industry.
Upon arriving in the United States, Helmut quickly realized his ambition extended beyond being an employee; he aspired to carve his own path as an entrepreneur, driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence within the trade.
Thus, in September 1977, Helm Tool Company was born, with Helmut at its helm as president.
Infusing the company's ethos with a commitment to top-tier quality and innovative engineering, Helmut ensured that Helm Tool would always offer customers the most efficient and cost-effective solutions.
​ Over the years, Helm Tool has flourished into a premier tool manufacturing entity within the Greater Chicago Area, garnering a national reputation for its trailblazing advancements in high-speed machining and high-cavitation tools.
Central to this success is Helm Tool's unwavering dedication to technological advancement, continuously reinvesting in state-of-the-art equipment to maintain its leadership position.
Moreover, the company's workforce remains integral to its ethos of continual improvement, actively engaging in seminars and training programs to stay abreast of the latest processes and techniques.

From the very beginning, our plastic injection molds are designed with an emphasis on efficiency and functionality, leading to time savings in production, longer-lasting tools, and fewer modifications.
Design for Manufacturability Matrix Plastic Products is committed to providing superior mold design, engineering and consultation services.
Design for manufacturability and efficient production is our primary objective.
By involving us early on in a project, we can work closely with your engineering department and help provide a smooth transition from part design to final product.
Our Engineers can receive your part design data in a variety of 3D formats: Siemens NX (.prt) SolidWorks (.sldprt /.slddrw) Parasolid (.x_t) STEP 203/214 (.stp /.step) IGES (.igs /.iges) Engineering Software SolidWorks ® Plastics Premium Advanced Flow Simulation SolidWorks® Plastics Premium is plastic injection molding simulation software that allows part and mold designers to optimize their designs during the initial stages of development.
Our engineers use it early in the mold design process to address any potential areas of concern regarding a customer’s part data (such as wall thickness, gate location, fill and cycle time, temperature, and consistency.) This ensures the most efficient use of time and resources, as it is significantly less costly to make part design changes prior to any actual prototyping or machining activities.
SolidWorks ® Premium and Siemens NX ® Our integrated CAD/CAM system features the latest version of SolidWorks® and Siemens NX® (formerly Unigraphics) software.
This ensures proper integration of all components and makes paperless mold design and manufacturing possible.
Our network of 14 workstations throughout our facility makes the read-only 3D master data accessible at every stage of the project lifecycle.
Our moldmakers are able to access the master model, interrogate it for dimensions, and begin the mold manufacturing process almost immediately, which is beneficial in meeting our customers’ compressed lead times.
During qualification and throughout production, our quality assurance department will also access this data to compare physical part inspection results against the reference design.
3D Printing & Prototyping Our experienced team of design engineers combine technical expertise, technology and a creative approach to provide a variety of intermediate steps to get you from an initial concept into production faster.
With our 3D Systems® ProJet MJP 2500 3D printer, we have the ability to produce functional plastic prototype parts directly from a 3D model in less than 24 hours.
Depending on the application, the resulting prototype parts can demonstrate basic functionality and testing for design verification and marketing approval, prior to any investment in tooling.
3D printing allows us to experiment with ideas about ways to make things better, faster and more economically.
We use it to design and produce virtually all of our inspection fixtures, and have even injection molded sample parts using 3D printed cores and cavities.
At the next stage of product development, our " development tooling " is perfectly suited to complex applications in the trial stage.
Tom Ziegenhorn, Design Engineer "Listening carefully to our customers to gain a complete understanding of their goals – and keeping those goals in sight at all times – is really the key to successful R&D.
Applying our technical experience to make those goals a reality is very rewarding." – Tom Ziegenhorn Request A Quote Request a quote any time day or night.
We apply our decades of moldmaking expertise in producing highly precise and robust Class 101 production tools for the most demanding applications: Highly complex parts requiring intricate mechanics Miniature and micro parts with extremely close tolerances Multi-component parts requiring multi-shot molding Medical and surgical components Our investment in CNC technology and machining automation allows our experienced toolmakers to meet compressed lead times while maintaining our reputation for quality.
Our Moldmaking Sweet Spots Matrix Plastic Products designs and builds tight-tolerance, thermoplastic injection molds to run in presses from 20 tons to 300 tons.
We are particularly well-suited to complex, miniature and micro-tooling projects.
Micromold Matrix Plastic Products designs and builds micromolds to produce extremely small parts with very precise micro features.
Steel components are machined and manipulated under microscopes and verified for accuracy through our high-end inspection processes at each stage of production.
Transfer Programs and Takeover Tooling The same multi-disciplinary expertise that affords Matrix Plastic Products total confidence in running our own hassle-free production molds is what also makes us so adept at managing transfer programs with takeover tools.
Our ability to identify and resolve the myriad of issues that often accompany a transfer program has led to double-digit growth in our production molding sales.
Upon receiving transferred tools, Matrix’s team of engineering, tooling, processing and quality experts thoroughly analyze the molds’ capabilities.
Any necessary adjustments to processing parameters or materials, and repairs or replacements of tooling components are quickly identified and implemented.
Our goal in a transfer program is two-fold: Re-qualify the tools to get them back into production with minimal disruption to our customers' delivery schedules.
Craft a plan to provide the lowest total cost of ownership over the remaining lifetime of the program.
We understand that customers usually transfer existing programs only when unexpected circumstances force them to.
Matrix stands ready to make the transition as painless and stress-free as possible.
We want our customers to feel that, in the long-term, bringing their program to Matrix was the best move they could have made.
Development Moldmaking – A Step Above Prototype Molds Some parts are not good candidates for traditional "prototype" tooling.
Complex geometries involving fine details or sharp corners often cannot be achieved with the softer tool steels and high-speed machining methods that are used in conventional prototype tools.
Engineering-grade materials can also be harsh on an aluminum or P-20 tool.
Matrix Plastic Products offers development tooling, a cost-effective alternative to traditional prototype molds.
Our approach consists of single-cavity, production-quality tools, built with hardened or pre-hardened steels to mimic production tool performance, that bridge the gap between proving out your concept and gradually moving into production volumes.
A series of mold samplings prove out the design and the ability to meet critical dimensions, incorporating any customer revisions along the way.
This cycle firmly establishes the groundwork for reliable plastic injection tooling that yields consist, repeatable component parts in production.
If volumes are expected to remain low, this production-grade tool may serve all your needs.
For higher-volume projects, the lessons learned with cavity #1 expedite the multi-cavity production tool build, getting you ramped up to production in less time.
Each project has its own unique issues to consider.
Our experienced engineers are committed to understanding your project’s specific requirements, and determining the most sensible tooling approach to suit your needs.

We guarantee you will be pleased with the high caliber of quality and service Matrix Plastic Products has to offer.
"Our wide range of Quality Assurance services affords us a comprehensive customer base.
We have several clients who prefer to have us assume complete control of their project, from the initial product sampling analysis to production part certification of conformance.
While others use us specifically for niche services like first article inspections, melt flow analysis, compression/tension testing or surface texture analysis." – Gary Johansson Inspection reporting is available in a variety of formats, which can be customized for each unique project.
First Article Inspections (FAI) A First Article Inspection provides objective evidence that our products have been manufactured to customer specifications.
Essentially, every critical design characteristic called out on the part drawing is verified and recorded using our OGP multi-sensor metrology systems which are touch probe, vision and laser capable.
Typically, one to three sample parts per cavity are randomly selected for this comprehensive evaluation method which can involve as many as 200 dimensions or more.
Matrix performs FAIs for all new parts, and once we are in production, we monitor those critical-to-function features for the life of the project.
Process Validation (IQ-OQ-PQ) Process Validation, or IQ-OQ-PQ, is a critical part of our quality assurance procedures.
By challenging the molding process parameters, we create a Molding Area Diagram (MAD) showing the upper and lower limits for pressure and temperature that will yield parts within specifications.
After we dial in to a process that will effectively control the quality of the product, a Gage R&R study confirms the accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility of our inspection fixture, instrument and inspector to prove that our measurement plan is sound and reliable.
The entire Process Validation protocol is approved by the customer prior to kicking off part approval and production.
Capability Studies and SPC Every process has inherent statistical variability which can be evaluated by statistical methods..
Our quality engineers can conduct a capability study to demonstrate the extent to which an established molding process is capable of producing parts within customer tolerance specifications.
The critical statistical measurement output of the study is Cpk (the expression of predicted process capability) and Ppk (the confirmation of actual process capability.) By understanding this process variability, we can utilize various SPC tools to monitor and control the process and identify opportunities for continuous improvement.
Our emphasis is on problem prevention vs.
detection after the fact.
PPAP The Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) establishes evidence that customer engineering design and specification requirements are clearly understood and fulfilled.
We use this process to demonstrate that the established manufacturing process will consistently produce product meeting all customer specifications during the actual production run.
Tension Testing Matrix performs tension testing, also called tensile strength testing, which subjects a sample part to a controlled tension until failure.
Moisture Analysis Moisture content plays an important role in the performance of thermoplastic resins.
Excessive moisture in material prior to injection molding can result in visual, dimensional and long-term performance defects.
Implantable and bioabsorbable resins are particularly sensitive to moisture levels.
Matrix performs moisture analysis testing to confirm that critical materials have been properly dried and are within the specified acceptable moisture range prior to processing.
Matrix welcomes the opportunity to tailor a custom inspection package to meet your unique inspection requirements.
So ask yourself: "What's important for my particular project?" When you choose Matrix to handle your project, you benefit from our core competencies: Experience in Concept, Design and Production Matrix Plastic Products has been designing and manufacturing the finest plastic injection molds and molded parts since 1978 in a very competitive market.

Nine years later the company moved again to a 6,800 square foot facility in Broadview, which would be the site of Pelco for the next 25 years, producing close tolerance, high quality tools for the Electronics, Automotive, Closure, Cosmetic, and Appliance Industries.
1991 brought the sale of Pelco to Dick Truhlar, Roger Wittersheim, and Rob Suva, three mold makers who have in excess of 100 combined years of mold making experience.
Emil Peluso who then was semi-retired, took on the roll as closure prototype designer.
In 1996, Pelco Tool & Mold built a 16,000 square foot building in Glendale Heights, IL.
The building was designed specifically to meet current needs as well as future demands.
It has the capabilities to produce high quality injection molds, as well as assist in customer production issues from engineering layouts to the final assembly phase.
In 2007 an additional 5,000 square feet was added to the Glendale Heights facility to make room for additional machinery and increase the assembly area to support larger molds.
Since the purchase of Pelco, the corporation has grown from 8 employees to 35 employees, with sales expanding from 1 million to 13 million.
The company provides a positive work environment for their employees.
With continued purchase of the latest high tech CNC equipment, the future of Pelco includes continued growth and expansion.
At Pelco we believe the relationship we establish today with our customers will determine our future for tomorrow.

Engineering Repairs Conversions/Revisions Preventive Maintenance Pelco Tool & Mold, Inc.
Take advantage of our years of experience and variety of plastic injection mold types to get the most out of your project.
Material selection and coatings can play a big part in the performance and durability of a plastic injection mold.
Small changes in part design can also create big saving in injection mold costs or eliminate trouble areas that may require extra maintenance and care.
Plastic injection mold maintenance is a big factor in the design of a Pelco mold.
Many injection molders appreciate the ability to remove mold components from the parting line for cleaning or replacement.
Grease fittings are incorporated in areas requiring daily maintenance.
Quick connect fittings recessed in the mold base allow for quick change outs while protecting the fittings.
Pry bar slots and mold straps with provisions to latch over plates are also maintenance friendly items that can be overlooked in a quote request or design review but make the task of mold maintenance a little less cumbersome.
When your existing injection molds have run their course and are approaching replacement time, the engineers at Pelco can review that existing design and suggest improvements or create electronic drawings from the old blue prints.
Injection mold components can also be reversed engineered and documented for those old or inherited molds that lack up to date documentation.
Pelco primarily uses Pro-E for design but we also have Solidworks, Autocad, and Cad Key to read and create all the common file types.
We can repair a core with an imperfection or an injection mold that needs a complete overhaul.
With advancements in laser welding it’s amazing how even the smallest intricate features can be repaired saving thousands of dollars in component replacement costs.
In cases where the part is not filling as well as it did when the injection mold was new, let us check the vents and establish a like new parting line to get that old mold back in service.
Often older injection mold frames can be re-used and just new molding surfaces can be designed and built to work in that old frame.
If your in-house tool room is back logged or not equipped to handle injection mold maintenance consider using Pelco Tool and Mold to help keep your investment running like new.
Combine any injection mold repairs or injection mold revisions with the rest of the injection mold maintenance and save time and money.

Building both diecast dies and plastic molds, the company began building a wide variety of molds for both compression and injection molding.
By 1977, Tri-Par experienced several important changes.
The original partnership between Henry Kugler, Arthur Fraske and Raymond Polcyn, no longer existed, and the company had moved first to Elk Grove Village, and then to Schaumburg.
At that time, Raymond Polcyn, the sole owner, welcomed a former apprentice and employee, William Plocinski, as his new business partner.
Within several years, Raymond and William realized they needed to expand not only their facility, but their business capabilities as well due to their growing business opportunities.
Tri-Par moved to Streamwood in 1990 and began injection molding at this new facility in 1994.
William’s son David joined the company three years later and continue to expand Tri-Par’s molding operations.
Ultimately, Tri-Par would move to Geneva and continue their business expansion (nearly doubling the size of the facility within 10 years) until they relocated to their current 58,000 square foot location in South Elgin.
Today, approaching 60 years in business, Tri-Par specializes in helping their customers reduce the total cost of injection mold tooling ownership.
By developing the technology and culture necessary to tool appearance parts with complex part geometries, critical parting line matches and precise shut-offs, Tri-Par designs and delivers tools that provide exceptional value.
“Our customers tell us that our molds have helped them reduce their setup time, maintenance costs and run faster cycle times,” William explains, “this reduces the total cost of ownership for their injection mold tooling.” Need more information?

We have a full team dedicated to production tool building, including project managers, designers, machinists and toolmakers.
The team has access to a full range of state-of-the-art CAD/CAM software and production equipment.
With these capabilities, there are no features—shapes, geometries, surface textures, and heat treatments—that we cannot accommodate.
Our new Technology Center expansion has allowed us to increase our capacity for building domestic tools, as well increase our productivity and the accuracy of our work.
We also understand your need to balance quality and cost.
To help facilitate production tool building on all budgets, we offer three different build options: fully domestic production, offshore production by our trusted partner in Shenzhen, China, or a hybrid China-U.S.
At Decatur Mold, we pride ourselves on being the tooling experts.
Whether you know exactly what you want or need some guidance along the way, we want to be your trusted partner for the next project!
Request a Quote Decatur Mold Overseas Option While we would love every tool to be built in our North Vernon, Indiana facility, we understand that not every project has the budget for a domestic tool build.
By offering both Hybrid and China builds for our customers, we are able to provide more options to meet your needs.
However, just because some tools are built offshore doesn’t mean we stand behind them any less.
Decatur Mold has built strong relationships with the best shops in Shenzen for the last 20 years.
We guarantee the quality of the molds built there and ensure nothing leaves until the customer’s needs are met.
We also provide a final tool inspection, cleaning, and sample at our domestic facility.
We feel our procedure for producing tools overseas reduces uncertainty for our customers.
Let us handle the details for you and reduce the effort and uncertainty in purchasing offshore tooling.

It may seem on the surface that prototype tooling is less useful today with the rapid growth of 3D printing in the last decade.
However, there are several reasons why prototype molds are still a valuable tool in injection molding.
Part Functionality and Material Testing: An injection molded prototype part allows you to test the part before production with the exact material you intend to use.
3D printed materials may not give you the exact material or strength a molded part will have.
Part Moldability: By working with an injection mold maker like Decatur Mold, design issues for molding can be solved before the production tool build, saving the customer time and money in the future.
Part Volumes: Prototype tools can very quickly and affordably produce thousands of parts.
Prototypes built out of more durable materials like P20 can serve as bridge tools, satisfying production requirements as a production tool is being built.

Ask a Question SWITCHING SUPPLIERS?
WE CAN MOVE YOUR MOLDS EFFICIENTLY What happens when you move a mold?
It has to be shipped to the new supplier.
If they don't have a toolroom in-house, it is shipped to their outside mold builder.
​ That mold builder needs to run a thorough inspection that involves checking for cracks, or imperfections on the mold surfaces, along with gates, runners, and ejector pins.
What if they miss something or something goes wrong?
That new supplier has to ship it back to the mold builder or previous molding company to fix the problem.
AND how do you get that time back?
That is exactly why ASH has a complete in-house toolroom with 15 skilled craftsmen and is also why ASH can move your mold quickly and efficiently.
MOVE-A-MOLD PROGRAM Move your mold SWITCHING SUPPLIERS?
MOVE YOUR MOLD MATERIAL EXPERTISE ENGINEERED PLASTIC RESINS & MIM ALLOYS Engineered resins are high-performance thermoplastics that offer you superior properties compared to commodity resins commonly used in injection molding.
ASH built our business learning how to work with these materials.
They are designed to meet specific requirements for applications that demand greater strength, heat resistance, chemical resistance, dimensional stability, or other enhanced characteristics.
​ As for Metal Injection Molding, your options include Stainless steel (316L, 17-4 PH.

Industries Served - Automotive, Construction, Electronics
Industries Automotive Eifel’s automotive experience runs deep as manufacturers of plastic injection molds for steering wheels, steering wheel bezels, airbag covers and other interior and exterior trim parts.
For 50 years, automotive OEMs and Tier 1s have experienced the competitive advantage Eifel brings to the relationship.
Automotive suppliers looking for a mold-making partnership and design for manufacturability expertise should reach out for a discovery call.
Being physically located in Fraser, Michigan makes Eifel a prime source for automotive projects.
In this case, our customer sought out a partner that could support design, engineering, and manufacturing throughout the plastic injection mold build process as well as the ability to provide a minimum viable product during the pre-production process.
Ultimately, Eifel was awarded the production mold project.
This is an example of why customers choose Eifel.
Our knowledge transcends mold construction by carrying over into part design and part processing.
The customer wins by aligning themselves with a turnkey manufacturing partner.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLES (RV) Recreational vehicle or RV means both motorized and non-motorized vehicles that combine transportation and temporary living quarters for travel, recreation or camping.
Many of these vehicles utilize plastic injection molded parts for both aesthetics and functionality.
Eifel recently completed a project for the RV industry where we built plastic injection mold for a toilet seat.
Additionally, we’ve worked on projects for riding lawn mowers and tractors.
RV OEMs and suppliers interested in partnering with a best-of-breed plastic injection mold source should reach out to the Eifel Team to discuss how we might work together.
ELECTRONICS Many OEMs or product developers utilize plastic to house electronics.
Eifel’s engineering team welcomes that opportunity to have manufacturing feasibility discussions to optimize product performance while supplying a mold that’s globally competitive.
Our experience working in a wide range of polymers and flexibility in producing tooling for low or high-volume production enable us to bring a variety of solutions to electronics OEMs.
Reach out to Eifel to learn more about our ability to support plastic part development for electronics applications.
ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EV) Over the next 10-15 years, it is estimated the EV adoption rate will surpass 50% in the United States.
As societies and users make that transition, so too will supply chains.
Eifel’s people, process and technology are vehicle-agnostic and, while EVs employ an entirely different powertrain than internal combustion engines, interior trim and functional parts will remain plastic injection molded because of the flexibility and versatility of this forming technology.
EVs also require different parts like battery lids, battery trays or battery boxes to encapsulate the battery, prevent water intrusion and provide battery protection.
Eifel’s Team welcomes new opportunities to review and quote on EV plastic injection molded parts.
SIDE-BY-SIDES (SXSS) & UTILITY TASK VEHICLES (UTVS) SxSs, UTVs, Tractors and Lawn mowers have a number Class A surfaces, some of which that are plastic injection molded.
Eifel has produced plastic injection molds for leading OEMs of utility task vehicles (UTVs) and side-by-sides (SxS) for many years.
We’ve long been known for our industry-leading expertise in the development of steering wheels using 2 shot or single-shot plastic injection molds.
For UTV and SxS OEMs seeking a partner in plastic injection molded part development, Eifel’s design-for-manufacturing (DFM) expertise increases speed-to-market and keeps programs on a budget.
Reach out for an introductory conversation and you’ll quickly learn why Eifel is a premier source to SxS OEMs for Class A plastic injection tooling.

Setting up shop in the back of Ray’s welding business, Rod and Gary pursued their dream of owning a tool shop.
Gary was a seasoned journeyman mold maker then, and Rod was still drying the ink on his certificate.
In 1984 Rod and his cousin Richard Nitz partnered, as Gary and Ray chose to move on to other employment and business opportunities.
Richard was also a seasoned mold maker and had always wanted to own a shop.
They decided to move the equipment to a rental facility in downtown Baroda where they remained for the next 16 years.

At Midwest Die, we’ll offer the best solution to your die casting needs, depending on several factors: The volume of parts required, The sizes of the casting part, The desirability of core slides, Cast-insert requirements (such as materials used), and Requirements for a “family” set of parts.
Prototyping If your project requires only a small number of die castings under production conditions, prototyping may be your answer.
A prototype die allows for meticulous testing and market exposure prior to the commitment of a full production die.
We offer various strategies and methods for approximating a die cast part for eventual production die casting.
Production Dies Production die cast dies range from those with single cavities and no slides to dies with multiple cavities and multiple slides.
we offer several types of production dies, depending on the specific parameters for your particular project: Hot Chamber Die Cast Dies Cold Chamber Die Cast Dies Multi-Slide Dies Squeeze Tools and Semi-solid Castings Unit Dies Trim Dies Trim dies are critical to the outcome of your die cast project.
works closely with reputable trim die shops near our location.
Conformal Cooling and Cooling Circuits Did you know that Midwest Die can also produce conformally cooled die cast dies?
Unlike conventional dies with straight-line cooling channels, conformal cooling uses cooling lines that curve and closely follow the geometry of the part to be produced.
The result is uniform part cooling, reduced molded-in stress, fewer part rejects, and reduced cycle times.
This can be a critical factor in thin-wall casting processes where improved strength is important.
Additionally, a properly engineered conformally cooled die typically reduces cycle time by 20% to 40%.
We’re Here for You… Regardless of your die cast die needs, let the professionals at Midwest Die Corp.
From start to finish, our dies are built to ensure your success.

About Us Model Die & Mold Inc.
specializes in the design and build of injection and compression molds, primarily for automotive/heavy truck, aviation, kitchen/bath, and architectural markets.
Founded in 1966 by Ray Brown, father of current President and CEO Gordon Brown, Model Die & Mold now employs more than 65 highly skilled tradesmen.
As President and CEO, Gordon Brown has hands-on expertise in all disciplines of the company.
He has worked at Model Die full time since 1979, becoming President and Board Chairman in 2003.
Gordon became the company’s majority owner in 2011.
He is now focused on developing lead managers and systems that will allow the company to move to the third generation.
Model Die & Mold Vision Statement Model Die & Mold will be internationally recognized as a leader in the design and build of injection compression molds for custom molders.
We will pursue sound financial strategies by focusing on providing customer confidence in the quality of our products, following through on commitments, and using up-to-date technology and processes.
We will utilize an experienced team of committed individuals who take personal responsibility for meeting the needs of our customers.
The CAD/CAM Revolution Unigraphics® CADCAM In action in the Engineering Department The introduction of CAD/CAM software has revolutionized the mold making industry.
And we at Model Die & Mold have grown right along with it.
This technology has changed the way in which designs evolve from concept (art) to the final machined, injected, stamped, cast-inspected output (part).
Today, there is CAD/CAM software available for every step of the development process, from the napkin sketch to the final inspection of the product when it goes out the door.
Here are just some of the advantages realized through CAD/CAM: Reduced design time due to more sophisticated design software and higher levels of concurrent engineering.
Reduced fabrication and machining time through higher speed and more accurate machines.
Greatly reduced tryout time, using front-end simulation to eliminate the need for expensive and time-consuming tool reworking.
At Model Die & Mold, our state-of-the-art CAD/CAM system, called UG/NX, takes our design, engineering and manufacturing processes to the next level.
It even allows created models to survive major changes to the design part, thereby avoiding model reconstruction that would delay delivery of the tool.
Our People + Our Technology = Your Success!
Equipment List Over our entire 50-year history, Model Die & Mold has been a technology leader.

The Model Die & Mold Team GORDON BROWN, President and CEO As President and CEO, Gordon is responsible for providing strategic leadership for the company to establish long-range goals, strategies, plans, and policies.
Gordon has been with Model Die & Mold for 37 years, “surrounded by smart, hardworking people.” For him, that’s the best thing about working at Model Die: “It’s great to be able to go in to work every day and know you have great people to rely on, who have your back when it gets tough.” He was born in Muskegon, Michigan, and moved to Kentwood when he was very young.
(He was five years old when his father incorporated Model Die & Mold.) Gordon began working at Model Die & Mold shortly after graduating from Newaygo High School, where he especially enjoyed drafting and science classes.
He then studied business management at Davenport College.
In his spare time, he plays guitar and rebuilds “anything mechanical,” looking for ways to improve efficiencies.
“I think I was supposed to be a tinkerer.” He also enjoys golfing and riding mountain bikes, road bikes and dirt bikes.
But his most exciting adventure involved jumping off a cliff in the Virgin Islands and parasailing more than 400 feet in the air “with nothing holding me but two little metal rings.” Married with three sons, aged 17 to 27, Gordon hopes the third generation will continue to successfully maintain the family business.
CARL PEARSON, Chief Financial Officer, Human Resources Manager Carl has been with Model Die & Mold since 2013 as CFO.
He previously held several finance positions, including Director of Finance for Paragon AG, Baker Perkins Ltd, and Corporate Controller for Trendway Corporation in Holland, Michigan.
Born in Grand Rapids, he attended Central Michigan University and Grand Valley State University, where he earned a degree in finance and accounting.
Carl also has extensive training and experience in operations management and human resources.
In his spare time, he enjoys fishing, bowling, basketball, softball, playing guitar and singing.
For Carl, the best thing about working at Model Die & Mold is the people: “They’re wonderful, dedicated, and hard-working!” KATHY MORRIN, Payroll and Accounts Payable Supervisor Kathy has worked at Model Die & Mold since 2005.
She was born in Washington, DC, but traveled all over as an “Army brat.” Kathy attended Grand Rapids Community College, as well as Michigan State University, where she focused on business and accounting.
Her interests run the gamut from equestrian show jumping, coaching riders at shows, reading, studying politics, and saving endangered species.
She says the best thing about working at Model Die & Mold is the “down-to-earth family atmosphere.” RIC BROWN, Purchasing Manager, Quality Manager, and Systems Administrator Ric started working at Model Die & Mold in 1985 at the age of 17.
During that time, he has worked on various projects in CNC and Engineering; he has held his current three positions for the last 11 years.
Ric graduated from “the School of Hard Knocks.” For him, the best part about working at Model Die & Mold is the people.
“A large portion of the employees have been here for over 20 years.
We are like one big family.” Born in Grand Rapids, Ric has three daughters.
JON HAMMING, Vice President of Business Development Jon joined the Model Die team in October 2020, but it’s not his first stint with the company – in the late 1980s, he completed his apprenticeship with Model Die.
Since then, Jon has worked in many capacities throughout the mold making industry.
He has built a reputation for team building and collaboration, delivering results.
Jon has also served as vice president of the Michigan Chapter of the American Mold Builders Association (AMBA) for more than 10 years, advocating for and sharing best practices through the industry.
Leisure activities Jon enjoys include hunting, fishing and classic cars.
TOM BAKER, Sales Manager As Sales Manager at Model Die & Mold, Tom is responsible for customer response and satisfaction.
Tom Baker started with Model Die & Mold in 1989.
For him, being taught the tool and die trade by skillful people has been a great gift that has broadened his world.
“The understanding it has fostered, has enriched many experiences beyond my workday.” Tom was born in Fremont, Michigan; he attended Calvin Christian High School and Calvin College in Grand Rapids, where his favorite subject was history.
He says the best part about working at Model Die & Mold is that “the multi-dimensional aspect of mold building adds interest to the workday.
The character and imagination of both the people we work with and the ones we serve continues to stimulate learning, build relationships and add satisfaction.” Tom is married and has raised eight children, ages 30 to 16.
“I tried to space out my lawn mowers.” BRIAN VANDER KLOK, Sales Sales, Estimating and Project Management Brian has worked at Model Die for 34 years, starting as an apprentice.
He worked his way up through the ranks, from die maker, die leader, section leader and manufacturing manager, to his current position in Sales/Project Management.
As a Project Manager, Brian enjoys the whole process of mold making: From the request for quote, to working with Engineering on the design, to ordering the steel and working with the shop, to sampling the part.
For him, the best thing about working at Model Die is seeing the smiles on his customers’ faces when they hold their finished product.
“It’s priceless.” Born and raised in Grand Rapids, Brian was educated at the National Tooling and Machining Association (NTMA) and Davenport University, where he specialized in mechanical drafting, shop and math.
In his spare time, Brian enjoys riding Harleys, hunting and fishing.
He is married and has a grown son.
DAN MORREN, Sales For Dan, the best thing about working at Model Die & Mold is the friends he’s made.
He particularly remembers the day he left work early for a Harley ride with those same friends (who happen to own the company).
Dan has been working at Model Die & Mold for over 30 years.
Born in Grand Rapids, Dan attended school in nearby Hudsonville and Allendale.
In his spare time, he enjoys motorcycling, boating, fishing and “all sports.” Dan is married, and has six children and 14 grandchildren (but “no great-grandkids – yet”).
Allen Vedders, Project Management Allen joined Model Die in September 2020 as a project manager.
Allen has worked in the tool and die industry for over 30 years.
Raised in Allendale, Michigan, he graduated from Unity Christian High School, and then attended trade school at the National Tooling and Machining Association (NTMA) .
Allen and his wife reside in Hudsonville, Michigan, with two of their four children.
In his leisure time, Allen enjoys camping and hunting deer and turkey.

Discover what Dynamic Group is capable of.
Explore Our Molding and Tooling Facilities Meet our Team Joe McGillivray CEO Joe didn’t just grow up with Dynamic; he grew into it.
The company has been a part of his life since childhood.
In 2002, a teenage Joe began his first job with Dynamic as a Maintenance Technician—washing windows, sweeping floors, cleaning machines, and painting walls.
Over the next fourteen years, he rose through the ranks from janitorial duties to press operation to project management and finally to CEO of the company in 2016.
“It’s an honor to help so many people have a strong sense of purpose.
It’s all part of our mission to ‘make better.” As CEO, Joe’s leadership leverages his long history of hands-on experience from the bottom to the top.
The sense of curiosity, humility, and steady-handed leadership he has cultivated means that while he’s always looking ahead, he never loses sight of the people who make progress possible.
When he’s not in the office, Joe spends his time hiking, camping, skiing, or playing disc golf with friends and family.
He appreciates the simple things in life: fresh air, real connection, and a job well done.
Show More Show Less Brian Kalina Director of Tooling Operations Brian’s journey with Dynamic spans three decades.
As a second-generation owner of Dynamic Group, Brian grew up, quite literally, on the family values that sustain us as a company.
From an early age, he saw firsthand what it means to take pride in your craft and care deeply about your team.
“To be part of a team that applies its ingenuity to find solutions—and takes pride in the results—that’s what it’s all about.” Brian started his career as a machinist and mold builder, so he knows the work from the ground up.
Today, he leads tooling operations with the same hands-on approach and steady focus, helping to standardize and sustain the great ideas and proven results that have kept Dynamic thriving for decades.
Regardless of the project at hand, he brings patience, precision, and pride to everything he builds.
Show More Show Less Nick Schroer VP of Operations Nick didn’t join Dynamic just to keep things moving—he came to help build something that matters.
With over ten years in operations and manufacturing, he knows how to keep production running smoothly and tackle tough problems.
But if you ask him, the most important part of his job isn’t numbers or processes—it’s people.
“One of my biggest responsibilities—and the one I care most about—is supporting the team and helping people succeed.” That shows up every day in how Nick leads.
He’s hands-on, easy to talk to, and always ready to step in and help someone grow.
Whether it’s solving a challenge together or just having a real conversation, he believes great teams are built on trust and support.
Outside of work, you’ll often find Nick in the woodshop, where he gets the same kind of satisfaction from building something with his hands as he does from helping someone develop their skills.
He also spends time mentoring—because for him, leadership doesn’t stop when the day ends.
Favorite quote: “Leadership is not about being in charge.
It is about taking care of those in your charge.” — Simon Sinek Connect with Nick on LinkedIn Show More Show Less Elizabeth Lasanen HR Manager To Elizabeth, the best workplaces aren’t built on policies—they’re built on people.
Since joining Dynamic in 2023, she’s been at the heart of our HR staff’s efforts to create a culture where the connection, growth, and authenticity of our people are our most powerful strategic assets.
I believe work can be a place where people grow, contribute meaningfully, and feel seen.” With her keen strategic eye in the HR sphere, passion for finding connections between people, and commitment to nurturing the human side of business, Elizabeth helps leaders lead better and people thrive not just as employees but as human beings.
When she’s off the clock, Elizabeth is a podcast host, DIY-lover, and mom of three.
Her love of all things creative shows why she came to Dynamic Group—like our engineers, she’s a builder at heart.
Favorite quote: “Be messy and complicated and afraid and show up anyway.” — Glennon Doyle Connect with Elizabeth on LinkedIn Show More Show Less Kevin Shutes VP of Sales & Marketing Since 2024, Kevin has led Dynamic Group’s sales and marketing teams to help the business expand to new horizons.
He came to help Dynamic deliver its world-class molding and tooling expertise to new manufacturers—and stayed for the unique, thriving culture.
“I love building momentum and helping my teammates gain confidence and new skills.” As a marketer, there is nothing Kevin loves more than rolling up his sleeves and getting in the mix, especially with the passionate and dedicated people at Dynamic.
Whether he’s shaping strategy or closing a deal, he’s always focused on how the team moves forward—together.
Outside of work, Kevin enjoys canoeing, camping, and traveling the great outdoors, as well as creative pursuits that allow him to work with his hands.

Recognizing the need for skilled trades and moldmaking in the Carolinas, the partners moved south from Michigan and Ohio and built the company using computer numerical control (CNC) as a standard.
This helped to sustain a high level of efficiency and accuracy, as well as the ability to run unattended manufacturing.
The Ameritech brand quickly became associated with quality.
In 1995, Ameritech joined a consortium of five larger manufacturing companies that recognized the need for a strong apprenticeship program, and the idea for Apprenticeship 2000 came to life.
The very heart and soul of a young, vibrant, energetic group of people became the cornerstone of growth for the company, while also providing the “toolmakers of tomorrow” the opportunity to learn the trade.
See www.apprenticeship2000.com for more information on this exciting program.
In 2000, Steve bought out his partners.
As global competition increased, lower-cost tooling became a key to survival.
In order to keep new mold builds from moving offshore, Ameritech’s management developed “lean” processes and systems, to reduce cost without sacrificing quality or engineering.
Clients respected the value that Ameritech offered, and a strong customer base allowed the company to continue to thrive.
Investment in technology, meticulous program management, and precise scheduling continued to create high quality at a competitive cost.
In 2004, the opportunity arose to purchase the assets of Pinnacle Mold in Ormond Beach, Florida.
Ameritech Die & Mold South ( www.amdiemoldsouth.com ) was born!
The management of “South” worked closely with the North Carolina facility to ensure the same quality and attention to detail was included in every endeavor.
In 2009, the company received its AS9100 B quality certification.
They also hired a military and aerospace expert, and Ameritech South diversified into another new business area.
Through each change, Ameritech Die & Mold has only grown stronger and better prepared to survive global competition.
We are confident that our business plan, financial independence and strong commitment to achieving world-class proficiencies will continue to keep us at the forefront of mold manufacturing.
If you're in need of superior manufacturing techniques, and on time deliveries, then Ameritech is the mold company that you've been searching for!

When you’re looking for a plastic injection mold maker, there are thousands of choices.
But when there’s no margin for error, there’s only one - Ameritech Die & Mold.
They strive for perfection in every mold they make.
Ameritech Die & Mold creates plastic injection molds for the largest manufacturers of airbags and automotive safety equipment in the world.
There is no margin for error with an airbag.
To save a life, an airbag must deploy in less than one-twentieth (1/20) of a second.
There are no second chances.
Airbag covers are one of the most complex injection molds to design and build.
The tear seam in an airbag cover creates some of the most challenging molding issues today.
That technology -- working with complex geometries, tight tolerances, and tremendous attention to detail -- can be put to work for you.
Ameritech builds plastic injection molds for the automotive, appliance, and consumer products industries.
They work with some of the largest manufacturers in the world.
Ameritech Die & Mold works in partnership with you.
They are proactive in the development cycle.
Everything is evaluated to the nth degree.
Looking for trouble spots, they work with customers to recommend changes.

I throw some pretty tough stuff at them, and they deliver.
We are thrilled to have Ameritech Die & Mold doing work for us," reports a long-time customer.
"We don’t do anything easy.
We strive for perfection in every mold.
We control processes that other shops would typically send to the bench to fix.
We machine steel to precise tolerances by minimizing cutter deflection and paying attention to chip load," says Steve Rotman, President, Ameritech Die & Mold.
Although Ameritech Die & Mold has been around since 1985, the company is young.
Apprenticeship 2000 is Ameritech’s competitive edge, knowing that they are prepared for the future.
The average employee is 31 years old with 15 years experience.
Ameritech’s culture is decidedly different and fully invested.
Automation and lights-out machining reduces your costs.
You get to market faster because over 90% of their injection molds go into production after the first sampling.
Do you need long-term production tooling?
Ameritech’s customers report twice the mold life, with half the preventive maintenance.

We Can Help Manufacturing Our Machines Services What We Do Products Our Showcase Careers Employment Opportunities Contact Us Get in Touch Services / What We Do Concept and Design Planning and Production Finished Product Value Added Service Turning designers dreams into reality.
Conceptualization and Design The transformation of your designerâs dream into a working reality takes a very special combination of talents.
While modern technology and high-tech machining play key roles in the process, the human element of skilled engineers and craftsmen, including moldmakers, technicians and machinists, also contribute to the master plan.
Since 1952, L&Z Tool and Engineering has demonstrated the ability to make ideas successfully materialize into the market place.
After receiving your plans in virtually any data format, L&Zâs team of highly experienced engineers carefully reviews every aspect of the project, working concurrently on each required step â from design to delivery.
L&Z offers customized design solutions in-house or we can link up electronically via modem or EDI to your CAD database.
After thorough review and project approval, the actual manufacturing process begins.
Using our SOLID MODELING capability, L&Z performs the following: A working prototype is created using CAD technology and/or 3D printing.
The designer electronically creates an exact engineering model of the parts involved in the project in 3-D employing various colors, textures and environments.
Where necessary, accurate prototypes are created using advanced rapid prototype modeling techniques such as RP, STL, SLA [Stereolithography modeling techniques] or Laser Based Metal Deposition [SLS] to anticipate and identify potential appearance or structural problems.
Using the latest 3-D design software, a mold design is created and reviewed with you, the customer.
With our cutting edge technology we are able to meet all of your requirements for single or multiple molds, in virtually any size or shape.
Planning, Scheduling and Production L&Z is proud to be an AMERICAN company producing every plastic mold, die, and tool on-site at our facility in Watchung, New Jersey.
The planning stage blends L&Zâs traditional master artistry with modern technology.
Based on your projectâs specifications we can accomplish the following: Generate a physical working prototype via the CAD system, CNC machine or a handmade model constructed by an L&Z craftsman.
A flow analysis and/or FEA can be performed by the L&Z team to predetermine the most efficient gating and to determine the feasibility and workability of your design.
Once you are completely satisfied with the outcome, the actual design detailing and manufacturing begin.
The finest materials are ordered and a production schedule is developed.
A combination of CNC and EDM processes are used to create geometries with any degree of complexity.
L&Z technology and equipment is constantly being upgraded.
We pride ourselves on our state-of-the-art facility featuring 4 and 5 axis high speed machining, wire EDM and EDM work cell.
The Finished Product The computers and machinery play an integral part in the completion of your project.
This technology, however, can never take the place of the artistry skills that L&Zâs experienced craftsmen possess.
The master craftsmen lend their moldmaking skills through intricate precision finishing and polishing touches with hand tools.
The majority of L&Zâs staff has over twenty years experience in the fine art of moldmaking and takes great pride in every tool that is produced.
Whether your project is large or small, simple or complex, the molds are carefully assembled and tested for precise fit.
L&Z guarantees that each part will meet exact specifications and be delivered according to schedule.
L&Z's Value Added Service As a value added service, L&Z can provide engineering changes, repairs, modifications or refurbishment of existing products according to exacting specifications.
L&Z is also one of the only mold builders to offer hand-engraving capability.

RELIABLE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Case Studies From Our Recent Work SURGICAL ACCESS Long Cannula Cooling Challenge A customer came to us with a cooling challenge involving a long cannula.
The parts were coming off the press at high temperatures that rendered them unusable .
As a short-term measure, the parts were kept longer in the mold to give them extra time to cool.
This lengthened cycle times, however, and was far from sustainable.
Find out how Atalys engineers came up up with a long-term, viable solution in this case study.
Read the Case Study FLUID IV AND DRUG DELIVERY Molding Tubes With No Draft Medical device parts with cylindrical shapes are traditionally designed to have tapers in both internal and external walls which facilitate easy ejection of the molded part from the tool without any issues.
There are times, however, when a part’s required tolerances and/or function will not allow for it.
This was the case with a customer who wanted a tubular component molded without drafts under strict tolerances.
Could the part be molded without any drafts?
Find out in this case study.

Contact Us WHITE PAPER How can you tell if what you have is a tough cooling problem?
Achieving the lowest possible cycle times in a given project is like finding the holy grail in plastic injection molding.
At Atalys, we have developed a method for estimating the optimum cure time (which is the largest component of cycle time) for each molding assignment.
In essence, the model allows us to quantify the cooling challenge to be overcome, and enables us to determine the key parameters of the mold design that would be necessary if the desired cure time is to be achieved.

Vast steel supplies and other support services are nearby to help us respond quickly to any order.
Our experience covers a broad range of markets including automotive, aerospace, medical, appliance, electrical and computers.
We’re ready to put our pride and expertise to work for you.
With steady growth since its founding Eagle Mold continues to deliver the highest quality engineering and craftsmanship (through our highly talented company personnel).
Eagle Mold built one of their 2 current facilities in 1988 and expanded several times since to the present 34,000 sq ft building.
The second 24,500 sq ft facility was built in the same industrial park in 2019.
For 40 years Eagle Mold has been supplying quality tooling to their customers and is proud to be one of the many small businesses that are the foundation of America’s economy.
Site created by Thomas Marketing Services Plastic Injection Molds - Eagle Mold Co., Inc.
, we specialize in the design, engineering, and fabrication of precision molds used in the plastic injection molding industry.
Our specialty includes the manufacturing of molds used to produce precision aerospace, medical, and automotive components, but our experience and expertise extends to a wide range of industries.
The first step to creating a premium quality mold is creating a CAD model and simulating the molding process.
Designs can be created based on a technical drawing of the molded component or a physical specimen that must be reverse engineered.
If needed, we can also provide guidance on optimizing a specific component for the injection molded process.
There may be ways to slightly modify the part which can save costs without reducing the functionality of the component.
Taking this into account early on in the mold design process can greatly reduce production costs.
Depending on the component design, specialty features such as hydraulic core pull, two-shot, unscrewing, and hot runner mold types can be used to accommodate unique part geometries.
Once the design has been finalized and approved, the precision mold is machined using advanced CNC milling and EDM equipment.
CNC mills have 5-axis machining capabilities, allowing even the most complex designs to be milled in a single set-up.
This not only increases machining efficiency, which in turn reduces overall costs and lead time, but increases the precision of the tolerances that can be held since cuts are referenced off a single point, eliminating the variability that inherently results from multiple set ups.
Electrical discharge machining, or EDM, equipment provides the ability to machine components to within ±0.0001″ and with surface finishes fine enough to meet the quality specifications of the most demanding manufacturing industries.
We are ISO 9001:2015 certified and perform all quality checks and inspections according to our stringent quality management system.
CMM equipment is present on the shop floor to perform dimensional inspections when needed.
The lead time required to produce a mold is dependent on the level of design work required and extent of the special project, but typical mold manufacturing projects can be turned around in approximately 10 to 12 weeks.
For additional information about our precision mold manufacturing capability, see the table below or contact us directly.
Site created by Thomas Marketing Services CNC / High Speed Machining - Eagle Mold Co., Inc.
are backed by a 30 year history of providing the most demanding industries with precision machined molds and production components.
We use the most advanced milling equipment available to produce a wide range of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and titanium parts for the aerospace, medical, and automotive industries.
Our 5-axis CNC milling centers are equipped with hard milling and high speed machining capabilities which allow us to hold precision tolerances while machining high strength material and complex geometries with maximum efficiency.
Without 5-axis machining, complex aerospace and medical components would have to undergo multiple machining cycles, resulting in additional set-ups and longer lead times.
The elimination of additional set-ups not only reduces overall lead time, it increases the precision we are able to achieve by reducing registration errors that can result from multiple set-ups.
Additionally, since in CNC machining there is no need to produce dedicated hard tooling, these processes can be used to economically produce lower volumes of custom parts.
Our quality management system is backed by an ISO 9001:2015 certification, which represents the highest standard for quality in the industry.
Dimensional inspections are performed using CMM equipment to verify conformance to all applicable quality specifications.
The lead time for a project is evaluated on a job by job basis but typical turnaround averages four weeks for production parts.
Expedited service is available as needed to fulfill rush orders in emergency situations.
For additional information about our CNC machining capabilities, see the table below, or contact us directly.
, we provide precision machining services through the use of sinker and wire electrical discharge machining, or EDM, equipment.
In electrical discharge machining, a concentrated electrical current is used to remove minute portions of the substrate material in accordance with the programmed design.
In the sinker EDM process, a custom machined electrode is used to remove material in the shape of the electrode.
The electrode is plunged into the material and erodes the material surface from the top down.
The electrical power is fine tuned to balance speed and surface finish with higher power settings used to create quick rough cuts and low power settings used to produce a very fine surface finish.
In the wire EDM process, a thin wire is used to erode the surface of the part to create straight or tapered cuts in the desired pattern.
Different diameters of wire can be used depending on the precision and complexity of the cut.
Any conductive material can be machined using EDM processes, but electrical discharge machining is especially well suited to the machining of high strength alloys.
High strength steel alloys such as Inconel and Monel are challenging to machine using traditional milling processes, as they rapidly work harden, causing machining to be laborious and costly.
If materials are tempered prior to machining and heat treated after the fact, precision is often lost in the distortion that can result from the heat treating process.
In electrical discharge machining, the properties of the material being machined are not affected, meaning tolerances as tight as ±0.0001″ can be held and no tempering of the material is required.
Modern EDM equipment is capable of cutting at much higher speeds than older systems, which allows us to provide EDM produced parts in a wider range of volumes than in decades past.
The lead time for each project is evaluated on a job by job basis, but turnaround typically averages four weeks for production parts.
Expedited service is available as needed to meet rush order deadlines.
For additional information about our electrical discharge machining capabilities, see the table below, or contact us directly.

Plastic Injection Molds Capabilities Process Specifications SPI Specifcations EDM Surface Finish Guide Portfolio Blog About Careers Contact SPI Specifcations CLASSIFICATION OF INJECTION MOLDS From the Society of Plastics Industry Moldmakers Division GENERAL NOTES The following classifications are guidelines to be used in obtaining quotations and placing orders for a uniform type of mold.
It is our desire through these classifications, to help even out inequities in the plastic molding quote system and eliminate customer disappointment.
It is strongly recommended that mold drawings be obtained before construction is started on any injection mold.
Even though parts may seem simple enough to not warrant a mold design, in the event of mold damage a drawing showing sizes and steel types will pay for itself.
These classifications are for mold specifications only, and in no way guarantee workmanship.
Workmanship is an individual and intangible thing.
It is very important that purchasing agents deal with vendors whose workmanship standards and reliability have been well proven.
Mold life, because of variations in part design and molding conditions, cannot be guaranteed.
We will attempt to give approximate cycles for each type of mold excluding wear caused by material abrasion, poor mold maintenance, improper molding technique, and inherent design factors.
Maintenance is not the responsibility of the mold maker.
Normal maintenance such as replacement of broken springs, broken ejector pins, worn rings, or the rework of nicks and scratches should be closely considered when deciding which classification of mold is required.
This document does not constitute a warranty or guarantee by the Society of the Plastic Industry, Inc., or its members for the classifications or specifications set forth herein.
MUD) Detailed mold design required.
Insert retainer to be uniform hardness of at least 280 BHN or (29 R/C).
All molding and/or functional details are to be made of tool steel hardened to at least 48 R/C.

The molder owns the unit mold base.
Because of the large variation in insert sizes, it should be kept in mind that it might be impossible to have product produced by another vendor without having to purchase a unit mold base.
(Important: Refer to the general specifications to complete the details of this section, except for prototype molds.) *Cycles are approximate and for comparison only.
GUIDE FOR PURCHASER CLASSIFICATIONS OF INJECTION MOLDS UP TO 400 TONS This section contains a brief synopsis of the various mold classifications.
The following section contains detailed descriptions of each mold class.
It is our recommendation that a “mold quote specification” sheet be included with each request for quotation.
A reproducible specification sheet is in the back cover.
TYPE 101 MOLD *Cycles: One Million or more Description: Built for extremely high production.
This is the highest price mold and is made with only the highest quality materials.
TYPE 102 MOLD *Cycles: Not exceeding one million Description: Medium to high production mold, good for abrasive materials and/or parts requiring close tolerances.
This is a high quality, fairly high price mold.
TYPE 103 MOLD *Cycles: Under 500,000 Description: Medium production mold.
This is a very popular mold for low to medium production needs.
TYPE 104 MOLD *Cycles: Under 100,000 Description: Low production mold.
Used only for limited production preferably with non-abrasive materials.
Low to moderate price range.
TYPE 105 MOLD *Cycles: Not exceeding 500 Description: Prototype only.
This mold will be constructed in the least expensive manner possible to produce a very limited quantity of prototype parts.
*Cycles are approximate and for comparison only GUIDE FOR MANUFACTURER MOLD INFORMATION CLASSIFICATIONS OF INJECTION MOLDS Note: In this section the attempt has been made to detail the materials and the processes to be used in producing the various classifications of molds.

United Tool and Mold's History Established in 1995, United Tool and Mold Inc.
When our first plant opened in Easley, South Carolina, we were focused on new tool builds.
We also dabbled with engineering changes and repairs, to keep the shop floor busy, but tool building was the main objective.
Five years later, we changed the structure of our business to be more of a provider of engineering changes and repairs to the local plastics industry in upstate South Carolina.
This change increased our flexibility and allowed us to take on all emergencies that our customers could throw at us.
2008 – United Tool and Mold Duncan, South Carolina Facility 2004 – United Tool and Mold Duncan, South Carolina Facility.
We stepped up into the large tooling market with the addition of our Duncan, South Carolina facility.
The Duncan facility allowed us to increase not only the capacity of our service, but also the size of the molds that we were able to work on.
With the ability to handle up to 125,000 lbs, Duncan has allowed us to separate ourselves from other shops in the size range of tooling that our company can work on.
In 2008, we expanded once again to include a small facility in Rainbow City, Alabama.
Three years later, we had outgrown that space and moved up the road.
Our Alabama facility can accommodate tools weighing up to 60,000 pounds and serves the US Highway 20 corridor -- from Atlanta to Mississippi -- and surrounding areas.
In 2019, we consolidated our Easley and Duncan, South Carolina facilities into a new 60,000 square foot facility in liberty, SC that allows us to better serve our customers.

Our driving factor is to support you in achieving your goals so that we can each do what is right for our customers, our industry, and the world.
We've had the privilege of partnering with individuals at many companies, including the ones below, to understand their challenges and create the ideal solution.
Read more about the benefits that back our products and solutions.
Generation and Transmission Distribution Substation Automation Microgrid Control Cybersecurity Generation and Transmission The generation source and transmission of electric power are undergoing rapid change.
Instead of a one-way flow of electric power from the transmission grid to the distribution grid, distributed energy resources create a two-way power flow—and a new set of challenges.
Additionally, there is a need to increase the capacity of transmission lines for a growing number of customers around the world.
As we try to get more and more out of our current equipment and infrastructure, it’s easier to add unwanted complexity in the pursuit of features and functionality.
We believe in simplicity, innovation, and reliability.
Our products are made of components that offer unmatched hardware quality and reliability.
We released solutions that operate using time-domain technology and traveling-wave fault locating.
Time-domain relays are less susceptible to fault current, increase security and reliability, and solve many of the challenges associated with traditional protection methods.
More About Transmission Solutions More About Generation Solutions Customer Highlight Georgia State Electrosystem Customer Highlight Elia Customer Highlight Tohono O'odham Utility Authority Success Story Uruguay (UTE) Distribution The landscape of electric power distribution is changing and becoming more complex.
Generation and demand patterns are shifting, and more sophisticated protection, control, and measurement devices are commissioned every day.
We counter that complexity with solutions that simplify and improve protection and control systems—starting with the industry’s most reliable electronic devices.
The mean time between repairs for SEL products is more than 250 years, so if you have 250 of our devices in your system, you can expect fewer than one per year to need unscheduled repair or replacement.
From replacing electromechanical relays to integrating distributed energy resources and implementing automated fault location and system restoration, we help distribution system owners meet today’s needs—and deliver reliable electric power well into the future.

Our engineers take the time to understand your needs and goals—and then, drawing upon decades of field experience, design and implement a solution customized specifically for you.
We provide products and complete turnkey engineering services for these substation automation solutions and more.
More About Substation Automation Solutions Customer Highlight Caribbean Utilities Company Success Story SCADA in West Texas Success Story Vietnam Electricity Success Story AEP Ohio Microgrid Control Microgrids play a vital role in aggregating and coordinating distributed generation assets and renewable resources.
They can provide resilience for critical infrastructure, help mitigate the variability of wind and solar power, and offer both economic and energy conservation benefits.
But they’re not one size fits all.
Each microgrid is a unique system that must be carefully engineered to maintain stability and meet specific operational priorities.
It must be able to island itself from the bulk power grid, operate indefinitely in isolation, and resynchronize with the grid without interrupting power to critical loads.
Making this happen seamlessly and reliably is among the most difficult challenges in electrical engineering—and that’s where SEL comes in.
Using our own electronic relays, automation controllers, and cybersecure networking systems, we custom-engineer the all-important systems that protect and control microgrids and integrate them with other electrical infrastructure.
And we’ve been recognized by prominent energy research institutions as the best in the world at ensuring that microgrids operate with maximum resiliency, efficiency, and security.
More About Microgrid Control Solutions Customer Highlight Montclair State University (MSU) Case Study Duke Energy Project Highlight UCSD Project Highlight Jasper Drillship Cybersecurity The scale of economic damage and potential loss of life that define today’s cyber attacks underscore the need for a better approach to cybersecurity for critical energy infrastructure.
While there is no single idea, product, or solution that creates cybersecurity—and security itself is a moving target—there are strong foundational ideas and principles upon which to build a solid cyber-defense strategy.
We have a long history of solution and product design for operational technology (OT) environments.
This has allowed us to build a deep understanding of the security considerations specific to OT networks, such as assumed trust between devices, deviation from baseline status, and how the concepts of confidentiality, integrity, and availability should relate to each other based on application.
We believe in building layers of defense and maintaining the integrity of each layer’s purpose—in other words, applying the right technology at the right layer.
We believe simpler products are easier to defend.
And the safety of the power system and availability of the protection and control devices come first.

Back to top The History of Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories
SEL Our History Innovation is the heart of SEL.
Schweitzer, III, invented the first microprocessor-based digital protective relay.
The SEL-21 was the culmination of research done for Schweitzer’s doctoral thesis, and it ushered in a new era of power system protection and went on to revolutionize the electric power industry.
He spent the next two years setting up manufacturing, business, and marketing processes, hiring a small group of employees, and working to teach the industry about the new technology and its benefits.
In 1984, Schweitzer flew to Fergus Falls, Minnesota, to provide a demonstration of the SEL-21 at Otter Tail Power Company that resulted in the first sale for SEL.
The grit, creativity, and spirit of invention that helped propel Schweitzer and the first SEL employees from the basement to more than 100 locations around the globe continue to be a driving force and source of inspiration today as the team of more than 6,000 people work to fulfill the SEL mission to make electric power, safer, more reliable, and more economical.
Timeline of Events 1982 Dr.
Schweitzer launches Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories with the invention of the SEL-21, the first relay to use microprocessor-based computation and algorithms.
1984 SEL makes its first sale to Otter Tail Power Company in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, as a company of seven working out of Dr.
1992 SEL grows to 100 employees.
1994 SEL implements the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
1997 We release the SEL-351, which becomes the benchmark for protective relay standards in North America.
1998 SEL begins offering engineering consulting, testing, and design through our Engineering Services team.
2000 We introduce our unprecedented ten-year, worldwide product warranty—the best in the industry.
2001 SEL establishes Government Services to serve government customers.
2003 SEL opens a site in Monterrey, Mexico, to manufacture high-quality panels for our customer Comisión Federal de Electricidad.
Schweitzer Manufacturing in Mundelein, Illinois, which was started by Dr.
Schweitzer’s father, Edmund O.
2009 SEL becomes 100 percent employee-owned.
2012 SEL opens a manufacturing facility in Lewiston, Idaho.
2016 We introduce the SEL-T400L Time-Domain Line Protection, the fastest relay in the world.
2019 SEL President and Chief Technology Officer Dr.
Schweitzer, III, is inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his invention of the microprocessor-based digital protective relay.
2020 We open the doors to our fifth manufacturing facility, in West Lafayette, Indiana.
The site’s proximity to Purdue University allows close research collaboration between the two entities.
2023 SEL opens a printed circuit board fabrication facility in Moscow, Idaho Back to top SEL Employee Ownership Company SEL Employee Ownership Own Your Career Creating a culture of ownership While still in the early days of the company, SEL founder Edmund O.
Schweitzer, III, began thinking about how to best serve the long-term interests of employees, customers, the company, and the community.
He looked into a number of business models, and in 1994, Dr.
Schweitzer sold a portion of his company stock to employees, establishing the SEL Employee Ownership Stock Plan.
The transaction set the company on the path to 100 percent employee ownership.
Schweitzer believed then, as he does now, that shared ownership is key for sustained growth, stability, and customer focus.
Employee ownership lets SEL put our customers and employees first.
“The career opportunities at SEL have turned my life around, and with the ESOP, I am now looking at being able to retire with a secure financial future.” Sarah A.
Manufacturing Supervisor “The ESOP provides a financial incentive to stick to our corporate values, provide superior solutions to our customers, and grow the long-term value of the company.” Bob M.
SEL Retiree “I was able to retire early at 54 because of employee ownership.” Nancy H.
SEL Retiree “The SEL story of being employee-owned is more than just significant retirement savings; owning a piece of the rock is part of our company’s corporate culture and our commitment to our customers.” Pamela C.
Senior Public Affairs Manager What is an ESOP?
An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) provides a company’s workforce with an ownership interest in the company.
In an ESOP, employees receive shares of stock in the company at no cost.

Frequently Asked Questions What is a sinker EDM machine?
Sinker EDM machines use an electrode submerged within an insulating fluid, such as oil or dielectric water, to remove minute amounts of material from a workpiece.
Commonly used in the tooling and mold-making process, Sinker EDM machines are an important tool in the precision shaping process.
What are the advantages of EDM?
EDM, known as electrical discharge machining, is a non-traditional option for cutting and shaping material where traditional machining methods fall short.
Advantages of EDM include the precise cutting of internal corners, the ability to shape thin walls, slots and other special part characteristics and cost savings from the lack of required special tooling.
While EDM and CNC machines feature similar construction and tooling capabilities, EDM uses electrical discharges or sparks to cut through metal instead of the sharp cutting tools CNC machines use.
