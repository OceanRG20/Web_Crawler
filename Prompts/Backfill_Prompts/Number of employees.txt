You are updating ONLY the "Number of employees" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Existing Number of employees cell (may be blank)
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank)
- Any other descriptive fields (industries, products, about text, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the "Number of employees" cell for THIS row, following these rules exactly:

1) Start from the CURRENT value in the Number of employees column:
   - If it already contains a site-based value (for example a value scraped from the company’s own website), keep that value and tag it with " (site)" if not already tagged.
   - Example: "50" → "50 (site)"

2) Use your general knowledge of public business data (directories such as ZoomInfo, LinkedIn ranges, etc.) to estimate a realistic current headcount for THIS specific company:
   - If you can infer a specific number or range from public-type information, add a second value in the same cell, tagged as "(public: BF 2024)".
   - Example: "~45 (public: BF 2024)"
   - Treat this as a rough but defensible public-data estimate, not an exact count.

3) Combine site and public values when both exist:
   - Use a semicolon and a space between them.
   - Example final cell: "35+ (site); ~45 (public: BF 2024)"

4) If there is NO reliable site value and NO realistic public estimate, but the Estimated Revenues cell is non-blank:
   - Use the revenue to back-calculate an approximate employee count:
       employees ≈ (revenue in dollars) ÷ 200,000
   - Round to the nearest whole number.
   - Return a single value with the tag "(calc from revenue_site)".
   - Example: "69 (calc from revenue_site)"

5) If there is already a clear, tagged combination (e.g., "50 (site); ~70 (public: BF 2024)"), you may keep it as-is unless you see an obviously better public estimate.

6) If you truly cannot infer ANY plausible value (no site signal, no believable public estimate, no usable revenue), return an empty string (blank). Do NOT write "unknown" or "n/a".

7) Output format rules:
   - Keep the result SHORT and human-readable.
   - Use one cell string only, e.g.:
       "35+ (site); ~45 (public: BF 2024)"
       "69 (calc from revenue_site)"
       "50 (site)"
   - Do NOT add any explanation, notes, or extra text outside that one cell value.

Below is the MMCrawl row for this company. Use it to apply the rules above and return only the final Number of employees cell value for this row.
