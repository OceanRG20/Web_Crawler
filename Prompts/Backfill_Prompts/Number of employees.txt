You are updating ONLY the "Number of employees" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Existing Number of employees cell (may be blank)
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank or partially filled)
- Other descriptive fields (about text, industries, products, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the
"Number of employees" cell for THIS row.

====================================================
CRITICAL GLOBAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================
You MUST NOT calculate employees from revenue if that revenue value
was itself calculated from employees.

If the Estimated Revenues cell contains:
"(calc from employees)"

→ DO NOT perform any revenue → employee calculation.

ALL OTHER revenue sources are considered independent and valid inputs,
including:
- site-based revenue
- news-based revenue
- square-footage-derived revenue
- public / estimated revenue

====================================================
PRIORITY ORDER (MANDATORY)
====================================================

1) SITE-BASED EMPLOYEE COUNT (HIGHEST ACCURACY)
------------------------------------------------
- If the cell already contains a site-derived employee value:
  • Keep it exactly
  • Append "(site)" if not already tagged

Examples:
"50" → "50 (site)"
"25 (site)" → keep as-is

------------------------------------------------

2) REVENUE → EMPLOYEE CALCULATION (PRIMARY)
------------------------------------------------
Use this if ALL are true:
• No site-based employee count exists
• Estimated Revenues exists (any type EXCEPT calc-from-employees)
• Estimated Revenues does NOT contain "(calc from employees)"

Formula:
employees ≈ revenue_dollars ÷ 200,000

- Round to nearest whole number
- Tag EXACTLY as:
"(calc from revenue_site)"

(This tag means “derived from revenue,” not literal site-only.)

------------------------------------------------

3) PUBLIC / THIRD-PARTY ESTIMATE (LAST)
------------------------------------------------
Use only if:
- No site-based employee value exists, AND
- No revenue-based calculation is possible

Format:
"~40 (public: BF 2024)"

------------------------------------------------

4) COMBINING VALUES
------------------------------------------------
- Separate values with "; "
- Required order:
  1) site
  2) calc
  3) public

Valid examples:
"50 (site)"
"25 (calc from revenue_site)"
"25 (calc from revenue_site); ~30 (public: BF 2024)"
"~40 (public: BF 2024)"

------------------------------------------------


5) WHEN NOTHING CAN BE DETERMINED
------------------------------------------------
If there is:
- no site employee data,
- no revenue data at all,
- and no public estimate,

then return exactly:

"NI"

====================================================
Return ONLY the final Number of employees cell value.
