You are updating ONLY the "Number of employees" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Existing Number of employees cell (may be blank)
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank)
- Any other descriptive fields (industries, products, about text, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the "Number of employees" cell for THIS row, following these rules exactly:

====================================================
PRIORITY ORDER (MANDATORY)
1) Site-based value (highest accuracy)
2) Calculated value (medium accuracy)
3) Public / 3rd-party estimate (least accurate)
Always output values in this exact order.
====================================================

1) START WITH EXISTING SITE VALUE  
   - If the cell already contains a site-derived value, keep it and tag with "(site)" if not already tagged.  
   - Example: "50" → "50 (site)"

2) ADD CALCULATED EMPLOYEE COUNT (IF NEEDED)  
   - Use ONLY when:
       • no site value exists, OR  
       • the calculated value adds meaningful clarity.  
   - Calculation formula:  
       employees ≈ revenue_dollars ÷ 200,000  
   - Round to the nearest whole number.  
   - Tag as "(calc from revenue_site)".  
   - This MUST appear **after site values** and **before public estimates**.

3) ADD PUBLIC / 3RD-PARTY EMPLOYEE ESTIMATE  
   - If you can infer a plausible public estimate (ZoomInfo-type data), tag as:  
       "~40 (public: BF 2024)"  
   - Public estimates must always appear LAST.

4) COMBINING VALUES  
   - Separate each value with "; "  
   - Required output order:  
       1) site  
       2) calc  
       3) public  
   - Example final outputs:  
       "50 (site); 69 (calc from revenue_site)"  
       "50 (site); ~70 (public: BF 2024)"  
       "50 (site); 69 (calc from revenue_site); ~70 (public: BF 2024)"  
       "69 (calc from revenue_site)"  
       "69 (calc from revenue_site); ~70 (public: BF 2024)"

5) WHEN NOTHING CAN BE DETERMINED  
   - If no site, no calc, and no public signals exist → output "" (blank).

Return ONLY the final Number of employees cell value.
