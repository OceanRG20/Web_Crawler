You are updating ONLY the "Square footage (facility)" cell for one company in the MMCrawl sheet.

You will be given the FULL MMCrawl row, including:
- The current Square footage (facility) cell (may contain site info, public info, calculations, or be blank)
- Estimated Revenues and Number of employees (may be blank)
- All descriptive fields (About, Services, Equipment, Industries, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the "Square footage (facility)" cell for THIS row.

=====================================================
RULE 0 — NEVER CHANGE THE MEANING
=====================================================
• Never delete an existing numeric datapoint.
• Never invent a new numeric value that is not supported by site text, public sources, or the revenue formula below.
• You MAY normalize wording/formatting (add “ft²”, change "(estimate)" to "(zoominfo)", fix spacing, standardize separators), but the underlying numbers and provenance must stay the same.

=====================================================
RULE 1 — MAXIMUM TWO ITEMS PER CELL
=====================================================
The final cell may contain:
- Up to TWO numeric items (e.g. a site value and a public value, or a site value and a calc-from-revenue value), OR
- A single token "NI", OR
- A single token "refer to site".

When more than two numeric items are available, keep at most TWO according to this priority:
1) Site value (highest priority)
2) Public value
3) Calc-from-revenue value (lowest priority)

Examples of allowed combinations:
- "23,000 ft² (site); 30,000 ft² (public: BF 2024)"
- "40,000 ft² (site); 55,000 ft² (calc from revenue)"
- "~30k ft² (public: ZI 2023)"
- "18,333 ft² (calc from revenue)"
- "NI"
- "refer to site"

Disallowed (do NOT output):
- Three or more numeric items separated by semicolons.

=====================================================
2) START FROM THE EXISTING CELL (NORMALIZE IF NEEDED)
=====================================================
Let “baseline” be the current Square footage (facility) value (may be empty).

If baseline is NOT empty:
- Preserve all numeric datapoints and their tags.
- You may clean up formatting:
  • Ensure each numeric item includes “ft²” somewhere.
  • Normalize "(estimate)" → "(zoominfo)" when it clearly refers to a ZoomInfo-type estimate.
  • Standardize separators as:  "<value 1>; <value 2>" (semicolon + single space).
- Identify which items are:
  • site items → tagged "(site)"
  • public items → tagged "(public: ...)"
  • calc items → tagged "(calc from revenue)" or obviously equivalent.
- If there are more than two numeric items, keep at most TWO according to the priority:
  1) keep the best site item
  2) keep the best public item (if present)
  3) otherwise, if needed to reach two items, keep ONE calc-from-revenue item
  Discard any additional, lower-priority items when there would be more than two in total.

If baseline is empty:
- You will construct the value from rules 3–5.

=====================================================
3) ADD SITE VALUE IF MISSING
=====================================================
Look for facility size in the row text (About, Services, etc.), e.g.:
- “our 45,000 sq ft facility”
- “a 30,000-square-foot plant”
- “20k ft2 shop”

If you find a clear site facility size AND there is no "(site)" item in baseline AND you still have fewer than two total numeric items:
- Extract and normalize it, e.g. "45,000 ft² (site)" or "~30k ft² (site)".
- Add it to the value (respecting the max-two-items rule).

=====================================================
4) ADD PUBLIC VALUE IF MISSING
=====================================================
If you can find a credible public estimate for facility size (e.g., BF, ZoomInfo, trade press) AND there is no "(public: ...)" item AND you still have fewer than two total numeric items:
- Add a new item such as:
  "~30k ft² (public: BF 2024)"
  "~25k ft² (public: ZI 2023)"

=====================================================
5) LAST-RESORT CALCULATION FROM REVENUE
=====================================================
Only perform a revenue-based square footage calculation when ALL of the following are true:
1) There is NO "(site)" item.
2) There is NO "(public: ...)" item.
3) Estimated Revenues is available and roughly credible.
4) You still have fewer than two numeric items.

Then:
- Approximate square_footage ≈ Revenue ÷ 600
- Express as:
  "18,333 ft² (calc from revenue)"
  or "~18k ft² (calc from revenue)"

=====================================================
6) WHEN TO RETURN "NI" OR "REFER TO SITE"
=====================================================
After applying all steps:

• If you still have ZERO numeric items and there is NO convincing evidence anywhere in the row that the facility size exists or is discussed → return "NI".

• If you still have ZERO numeric items but the row clearly talks about the plant / facility in a way that suggests a size is known but not stated (e.g., “our large multi-building facility”, “multi-plant campus”) → return "refer to site".

• If you have one or two numeric items → return those items only (no "NI" or "refer to site" in combination with numbers).

=====================================================
7) OUTPUT FORMAT
=====================================================
• Output ONE final line only.
• Use "ft²" for square feet.
• Separate multiple items with "; " (semicolon + single space).
• Do NOT output more than TWO numeric items.
• No commentary or explanation; ONLY the final cell value.
