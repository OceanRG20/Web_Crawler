You are updating ONLY the "Square footage (facility)" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Square footage (facility) cell (may be blank, partial, or estimated)
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Number of employees cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Other descriptive fields (about text, services, equipment, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the "Square footage (facility)" cell for THIS row, following these rules exactly:

1) Use and preserve site data when available
- If the current "Square footage (facility)" cell already contains a believable figure that clearly comes from the company’s own website, keep that value and tag it with "(site)" if not already tagged.
- If the row text (About, services, etc.) clearly states a facility size (e.g. “our 45,000 sq ft facility”), convert that into a clean numeric expression and treat it as a site value.
- Site values should normally look like "~30k ft² (site)" or "45,000 ft² (site)".

2) Add public-source square footage when available
- Search public, third-party sources (trade publications, databases, etc.) for facility square footage for this company.
- When you find a public estimate, add it, tagged as "(public: <source><year>)" where <source> is a short tag (e.g. BF, ZI, trade press) and <year> is the year of the estimate.
- If both site and public values exist, combine them in ONE cell, separated by a semicolon.
  Example: "23,000 ft² (site); 30,000 ft² (public: trade press 2010)".

3) Last-resort calculation from revenue ONLY
- Do NOT back-calculate square footage unless BOTH:
  • there is no usable site value, AND  
  • there is no usable public value, AND  
  • Estimated Revenues are available and roughly credible.
- In that case only, use a last-resort estimate:
  • sq ft ≈ Revenue ÷ 600
  • Express the result as a rounded, human-readable number (for example: "18,333 ft²" or "~18k ft²").
  • Tag it as "(calc from revenue)".
- If you also have a weak / noisy revenue estimate, you may still do this calc, but it should always be clearly labeled as "(calc from revenue)".

4) When to leave blank
- If there is no clear site value, no good public value, and no credible revenue to support a calculation, leave the square footage cell blank (do NOT invent a number).

5) Style and formatting
- Keep the result short and human-readable.
- Use "ft²" for square feet where possible.
- Separate multiple sources with " ; " (space-semicolon-space).
- Do NOT add any commentary, explanations, or extra text beyond the final value for the cell.

Examples of valid final outputs:
- "23,000 ft² (site); 30,000 ft² (public: trade press 2010)"
- "~55k ft² (public: BF 2024)"
- "18,333 ft² (calc from revenue)"
- ""  (completely blank if nothing can be derived)
