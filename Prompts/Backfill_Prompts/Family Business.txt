You are updating ONLY the "Family business" column in MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Ownership column (may describe ownership structure, history, individuals, etc.)
- Family business column (may be blank, "Yes", "NI", or "refer to site")
- Other descriptive fields (years of operation, notes, etc.)

Your job is to decide what the value of the "Family business" cell should be, based ONLY on the content of the row, with special attention to the Ownership column.

Possible outputs (must be exactly one of these, case-sensitive):
- Yes
- NI
- refer to site

Rules:

1. Respect existing confirmed "Yes":
   - If the current Family business cell already contains "Yes" (case-insensitive), output "Yes" and do NOT change it.

2. When the current Family business value is "refer to site":
   - You must analyze the Ownership column and decide whether the company is clearly a family-owned business or not.
   - Only in this case (existing value = "refer to site") are you allowed to change the value.

3. When Ownership clearly indicates a family business → output "Yes":
   - If the Ownership text clearly states or strongly implies that the company is family-owned or family-run, output "Yes".
   - Examples of clear indicators (case-insensitive, may be part of a longer sentence):
     • "family-owned"
     • "family owned"
     • "family-run"
     • "family run"
     • "family-operated"
     • "family operated"
     • "family business"
     • "second-generation" or "third-generation" (when referring to ownership)
     • phrases such as "founded by X; now operated by his son/daughter", "multi-generation family company", etc.
   - If multiple owners are all from the same family and the text describes this as a family company, treat it as "Yes".

4. When Ownership describes specific individual owners but NOT clearly as a family business → output "refer to site":
   - If the Ownership text names one or more individuals but does NOT use any of the family-related phrases above, treat this as ambiguous.
   - Examples:
     • "Privately held; owned by John Smith"
     • "Owned by Jane Doe, President"
     • "Privately held; owned by John and Mary Smith"
   - In these cases, you cannot safely classify it as a family business, so you must output "refer to site".

5. When Ownership gives no useful signal → output "NI":
   - If Ownership is blank or only contains generic phrases such as:
     • "Privately held"
     • "Privately owned"
     • "Independent company"
     • "Employee-owned" (with no mention of family)
     • other neutral descriptions with no clear family indication
   - And there is no other part of the row that clearly indicates the company is family-owned,
   - Then output "NI".

6. Safety / precedence:
   - Never infer "Yes" based solely on common surnames or guesses.
   - Only output "Yes" when the text clearly supports that the business is family-owned or family-run.
   - Otherwise prefer "refer to site" (for named individual owners) or "NI" (for generic/unknown ownership).

Output format:
- Return exactly ONE of: "Yes", "NI", or "refer to site".
- Do not add explanations, quotes, or any other text.
