You are updating ONLY the "Ownership" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Other descriptive fields (industry, employees, products, etc.)
- Public information may be available through reasoning on the company website URL.

Rules:

1. Add verified ownership information only if it is missing or incomplete:
   - privately held?
   - family-owned?
   - subsidiary?
   - founder history?
   - ownership changes?
2. If the Ownership cell has correct information, keep it.
3. Append new information; do NOT overwrite valid existing data.
4. Keep the result short, factual, and consistent with MMCrawl tone.

Your output must return ONLY the final Ownership cell content for THIS row.
