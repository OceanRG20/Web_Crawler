You are updating ONLY the "Estimated Revenues" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank or partially filled)
- Number of employees cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Facility square footage cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Other descriptive fields (about text, industries, products, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the
"Estimated Revenues" cell for THIS row.

====================================================
CORE RULE: NEVER REMOVE EXISTING VALUES
====================================================
- If the Estimated Revenues cell already contains any values (site/news/calc/public),
  you MUST KEEP them.
- You may only:
  (a) add missing tags if needed, and/or
  (b) append a missing calculated value (only if allowed by the rules), and/or
  (c) append a missing public estimate (only if you have a strong signal).
- Do NOT overwrite the cell with a single new value if it already has content.

====================================================
ANTI-CIRCULAR / ONE-CALC RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================
Only ONE calculation type is allowed in the final revenue cell:
- Either "(calc from employees)" OR "(calc from sqft)" — NEVER both.
If either calc already exists in the cell, DO NOT add another calc type.

Also:
- If employees appear to be derived from revenue (e.g., employees cell says "(calc from revenue_site)"),
  then DO NOT add "(calc from employees)" revenue. Prefer sqft calc if allowed, otherwise skip calc.

====================================================
FINAL OUTPUT ORDER (MANDATORY)
====================================================
Values must appear in this order in the final cell:
1) News-based revenue (news YYYY)
2) Site-based revenue (site)
3) ONE calculated revenue (either calc from employees OR calc from sqft)
4) Public estimates (public: ZI/BF/etc.)

Separate each value with "; "

====================================================
STEP 1 — PARSE & PRESERVE EXISTING REVENUE CELL CONTENT
====================================================
- Keep every existing revenue entry already present in the cell.
- If an existing entry is clearly site-based but missing the "(site)" tag, add it.
- If an existing entry is clearly news-based but missing "(news YYYY)", add it if year is known.
- Do NOT change numbers unless they are obviously malformed.

====================================================
STEP 2 — ADD NEWS-BASED REVENUE (IF FOUND AND NOT ALREADY PRESENT)
====================================================
- If confident revenue is stated in news/press releases, add it (if missing).
- Tag as "(news YYYY)".
- Insert it at the very beginning (before site).

====================================================
STEP 3 — ADD SITE-BASED REVENUE (IF FOUND AND NOT ALREADY PRESENT)
====================================================
- If revenue is found on the company site and not already in the cell, add it.
- Tag as "(site)".
- Place after news, before calc/public.

====================================================
STEP 4 — ADD ONE CALCULATED REVENUE (ONLY IF ALLOWED AND USEFUL)
====================================================
You may append ONE calc revenue ONLY if:
- A calc revenue is NOT already present in the existing cell, AND
- Adding it provides useful clarity (e.g., no strong site/news revenue), AND
- It does not violate the anti-circular rule above.

4A) EMPLOYEES → REVENUE (PRIMARY CALC)
Use ONLY if:
- Employee count exists, AND
- Employee count is not derived from revenue (not tagged "(calc from revenue_site)"), AND
- No calc revenue already exists in the revenue cell.

Formula:
revenue ≈ employees × 200,000
- Round to clean values (e.g., "$12M")
- Tag EXACTLY: "(calc from employees)"

4B) SQFT → REVENUE (LAST RESORT CALC)
Use ONLY if ALL are true:
- No usable employee data exists, AND
- No calc revenue already exists in the revenue cell, AND
- Square footage exists.

Formula:
revenue ≈ sqft × 600
- Tag EXACTLY: "(calc from sqft)"

====================================================
STEP 5 — PUBLIC ESTIMATES (ALWAYS LAST, PRESERVE EXISTING)
====================================================
- Keep any existing public estimate entries.
- Add a public estimate only if you have a plausible signal.
- Tag examples:
  "(public: ZI 2023)"
  "(public: BF 2024)"
- Public entries must always be last.

====================================================
DE-DUPLICATION RULE
====================================================
- Do not add duplicates of the same value+tag already present.
- If the same number exists with different tags, keep both but maintain ordering rules.

====================================================
IF THE CELL IS BLANK
====================================================
- If absolutely no revenue information can be inferred at all, return exactly:
NI

====================================================
Return ONLY ONE final revenue cell string.
