You are updating ONLY the "Estimated Revenues" column in a sheet called MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Company Name
- Estimated Revenues cell (may be blank or partially filled)
- Number of employees cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Facility square footage cell (may be blank or estimated)
- Other descriptive fields (about text, industries, products, etc.)

Your job is to return the FINAL value that should be written into the
"Estimated Revenues" cell for THIS row.

====================================================
MANDATORY PRIORITY ORDER FOR FINAL OUTPUT
====================================================
1) Site-based revenue (highest credibility)
2) Calculated revenue (medium credibility)
3) Public / third-party estimates (lowest credibility)

Values must ALWAYS appear in this exact order in the final cell.

====================================================
CRITICAL SKIP RULE — SITE REVENUE
====================================================
- If the Estimated Revenues cell ALREADY contains a site-based value
  (tagged "(site)" or clearly sourced from the company website):
  → DO NOT add any calculated revenue.
  → DO NOT add employee-based or sqft-based estimates.
  → Preserve the site value as-is and return the cell.

====================================================
STEP 1 — START WITH EXISTING DATA
====================================================
- Preserve any valid site-based value and tag it as "(site)" if missing.
- If multiple site values exist, keep them first in the output.

====================================================
STEP 2 — NEWS-BASED VALUES (IF ANY)
====================================================
- If confident revenue appears in news/press:
  - Treat as equivalent to site accuracy.
  - Tag as "(news YYYY)".
  - Place BEFORE site values.

FINAL ORDER SO FAR:
1) News
2) Site

====================================================
STEP 3 — CALCULATED REVENUE (EMPLOYEES → REVENUE)
====================================================
- Use ONLY if:
  - NO site-based revenue exists, AND
  - NO news-based revenue exists.
- Formula:
    revenue ≈ employees × 200,000
- Round to clean values (e.g., "$12M").
- Tag: "(calc from employees)"
- Must appear AFTER news/site and BEFORE public estimates.

====================================================
STEP 4 — CALCULATED REVENUE (SQFT → REVENUE)
====================================================
- Use ONLY if:
  - NO site-based revenue exists, AND
  - NO news-based revenue exists, AND
  - no usable employee count exists, AND
  - square footage is available.
- Formula:
    revenue ≈ sqft × 350
- Tag: "(calc from sqft)"
- Must appear BEFORE public estimates.

====================================================
STEP 5 — PUBLIC DIRECTORY ESTIMATES
====================================================
- ZoomInfo / D&B / similar directories.
- Tag: "(public: ZI 2023)" or "(public: BF 2024)"
- These ALWAYS appear LAST.

====================================================
IF ABSOLUTELY NO REVENUE INFORMATION EXISTS
====================================================
Return exactly:
NI

====================================================
Return ONLY ONE final revenue cell string.
