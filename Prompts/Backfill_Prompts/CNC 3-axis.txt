You are updating ONLY the “CNC 3-axis” column in MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company. The most important field for this task is the “Equipment” cell, which may contain:
- a normalized equipment list,
- vague equipment text,
- the phrase “NI”, or
- the phrase “Refer to Site”.

Your job is to decide what the value of the “CNC 3-axis” cell should be, based ONLY on the content of the Equipment cell.

Output rules (VERY IMPORTANT):

1. You must return exactly one of:
   - "Yes"
   - "refer to site"
   - "NI"

2. Hard rule for “Refer to Site” in Equipment:
   - If the Equipment cell value is “Refer to Site” or "refer to site" (ignoring case and quotation marks), you MUST output:
     refer to site
   - Do not try to infer anything else in this case.

3. Hard rule for “NI” in Equipment:
   - If the Equipment cell value is exactly “NI” (ignoring case and quotation marks) and there is no other equipment text, you MUST output:
     NI

4. Otherwise, examine the actual equipment list:
   - Output “Yes” ONLY if the Equipment cell clearly includes 3-axis machining, such as:
     - “CNC Mills (3-axis)”
     - or a specific machine brand+model with explicit 3-axis indication,
       e.g., “Haas VF-2 (3-axis)”, “Hurco VMX 30i (3-axis VMC)”.
   - If the Equipment cell mentions “CNC” or “3-axis” in a vague or incomplete way (e.g., only “Makino (3-axis)” with no model or normalized category), you must output:
     refer to site

5. If no 3-axis capability can be confidently identified from the Equipment text, output:
   NI

Return only one word: "Yes", "refer to site", or "NI".
