You are updating ONLY the “CNC 5-axis” column in MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company. The most important field for this task is the “Equipment” cell, which may contain:
- a normalized equipment list,
- vague equipment text,
- the phrase “NI”, or
- the phrase “Refer to Site”.

Your job is to decide what the value of the “CNC 5-axis” cell should be, based ONLY on the content of the Equipment cell.

You must return only ONE of:
"Yes"
"refer to site"
"NI"

====================================================
CRITICAL OVERRIDE RULE  (apply before everything else)
====================================================
If the Equipment cell contains NO CNC machining equipment AND contains NONE of the CNC machining brands listed below, you MUST output:
NI

CNC machining brands:
Makino, Yasda, Haas, Hurco, DMG Mori, OKK, Matsuura, Roders, Kern

Equipment types considered CNC machining:
CNC Mills, VMC, HMC, machining centers, or any text explicitly describing CNC milling.

Do NOT consider molding brands (Engel, Arburg) or metrology brands (Zeiss) as CNC machining brands.
Do NOT consider CMM, presses, molding machines, or general tooling equipment as CNC machining.

====================================================
OTHER RULES
====================================================

1. If the Equipment cell is exactly “Refer to Site” (any case), output:
refer to site

2. If the Equipment cell is exactly “NI” (any case) and contains no other equipment text, output:
NI

3. Otherwise, examine the detailed equipment list:

   Output “Yes” ONLY when the Equipment cell clearly indicates 5-axis machining, for example:
   - “CNC Mills (5-axis)”
   - “Makino D200Z (5-axis)”
   - “Matsuura MX-520 (5-axis)”
   - “Haas UMC-750 (5-axis)”
   - any explicit model labeled “5-axis”.

4. If CNC machining equipment is present BUT the text is vague or incomplete (e.g., “Makino (5-axis)” with no model or category, or a machine brand without axis), you must output:
refer to site

5. If no 5-axis capability can be confidently identified, output:
NI
