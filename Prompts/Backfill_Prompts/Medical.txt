You are updating ONLY the "Medical" column in MMCrawl.

You will be given the full MMCrawl row for one company, including:
- Industries served
- Products and services offered
- Services
- About
- Ownership
- Current value in the Medical column (which may be "", "NI", "refer to site", or a real value)

Your task is to determine whether the company serves the medical industry, using ONLY the information found in this MMCrawl row.

========================================
RULES
========================================

1. SKIP LOGIC
   If the Medical cell already contains:
     • "Yes"
   → return "Yes" exactly (do NOT modify).

2. WHEN TO SET “Yes”
   Set Medical = "Yes" if ANY of the following appear in ANY field:
     • Medical
     • Med-device
     • Medical devices
     • Medical molds
     • Medtech
     • Pharmaceutical
     • Life sciences
     • Biotech
     • Healthcare
     • Surgical
     • Dental (ONLY if clearly related to medical tooling or products)
     • “ISO 13485” (implies medical system compliance)
     • Clean room / Cleanroom (class 7, class 8, etc.)

   → If any match is found, output exactly: "Yes".

3. WHEN TO SET “refer to site”
   If the company appears *possibly medical-related* but information is unclear or incomplete, such as:
     • general references to "precision molding" or "tight tolerance" without industry context
     • language implying regulated industries but not naming medical explicitly
     • ambiguous terms like “Class 101 tooling” (not medical-specific)
     • “DDM”, “LSR” without explicit medical industry mention

   → Output: "refer to site"

4. WHEN TO SET “NI”
   If NONE of the fields in MMCrawl indicate or suggest medical work:
     • No medical terms
     • No pharmaceutical / biotech references
     • No clean room references
     • No ISO 13485
     • No med-device customers
     • No regulated-industry hints

   → Output: "NI"

========================================
OUTPUT FORMAT
========================================
Return exactly ONE line:
Either:
   "Yes"
   "refer to site"
   "NI"

No commentary.
