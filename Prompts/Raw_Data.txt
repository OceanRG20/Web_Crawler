Company: <Official Company Name>  

About:  
- 2–5 concise bullets summarizing what is known about the company — include founding year (if available), headquarters location, key specialties, materials, technologies, certifications (ISO 9001, AS9100, ITAR, etc.), and ownership structure (family-owned, privately held, subsidiary, etc.).  
- Include context about what the company manufactures or specializes in.  
- Use only data from the company’s own website or a verifiable same-entity public listing (same name, same city/state).  
- Never mix information from different companies or unrelated states.

Services:  
- 4–10 bullet points describing core capabilities, processes, or machinery referenced on the site (e.g., injection mold building, design and engineering, EDM machining, tryout molding, validation, repair, etc.).  
- Include references to specific processes, but do not copy marketing slogans or filler phrases.

Industries:  
- 3–6 bullet points summarizing the industries served (e.g., Medical, Pharmaceutical, Automotive, Aerospace, Packaging, Consumer, Industrial, Electronics).

Square footage (facility):  
- ONE line only after this label, no bullets.  
- Always try to output a numeric facility size, combining all credible datapoints from site and public sources.  
- The value MUST always include at least one parenthetical source or explanation — never a bare number.  
  - If listed on site:  
    Square footage (facility): 50,000 ft² (site)  
  - Site + public:  
    Square footage (facility): 50,000 ft² (site); ~60,000 ft² (public: Buzzfile 2024)  
  - Public only:  
    Square footage (facility): ~40,000 ft² (public: BF 2024)  
  - If approximate / inferred:  
    Square footage (facility): ~30,000 ft² (estimate)  
- Do NOT output just `23000` or `50,000 ft²` without parentheses; always attach `(site)`, `(public: …)` or `(estimate)`.

Number of employees:  
- ONE line only after this label, no bullets.  
- Always try to output a numeric headcount, combining all credible datapoints from site and public sources.  
- The headcount value MUST always include at least one parenthetical source or explanation — never a bare number.  
  - Site + public example:  
    Number of employees: 45+ (site); ~50 (public: LinkedIn 2024)  
  - Site only:  
    Number of employees: 30 (site)  
  - Public only:  
    Number of employees: ~80 (public: LinkedIn 2024)  
  - If unknown but inferable, give a numeric estimate with provenance:  
    Number of employees: ~40 (estimate)  
- Separate multiple datapoints with “; ” (semicolon + space).  
- Do NOT output plain `30` or `~80` with no parentheses.

Estimated Revenues:  
- ONE line only after this label, no bullets.  
- Always try to output a numeric revenue figure or range in dollars, combining all credible datapoints from site and public sources.  
- The revenue value MUST always include at least one parenthetical source or explanation — never a bare number.  
- Format examples (follow these patterns):  
  - Estimated Revenues: ~$14M (public: ZoomInfo 2024)  
  - Estimated Revenues: ~$7M (calc from employees)  
  - Estimated Revenues: ~$6M (calc from employees & sq footage)  
  - Estimated Revenues: $10–25M (public: ZoomInfo 2024)  
  - Estimated Revenues: ~$5M (estimate)  
- Use “M” for millions, “K” for thousands when reasonable (e.g., “$12–18M”, “$750K–$1.2M”).  
- Do NOT output plain `~$17.9M` with no parentheses; always include `(public: …)` or `(estimate)` etc.

Ownership:  
- Describe ownership and leadership (e.g., “Privately held; family-owned; President Jane Doe”).  
- Include history if available (e.g., “Founded in 1985; second-generation ownership”).

Equipment:  
- Return exactly one line after “Equipment:”.  
- Extract ONLY real capital equipment that appears on the company’s website (text OR photos). Never guess, never invent.  
- PRIORITY ORDER (follow strictly):
  
  1. Exact brand + model + axis/type + quantity  
     - Extract when visible in text OR shown in machine photos OR listed in an equipment list.  
     - Format: Brand Model (Axis/Type) ×qty  
     - Examples:  
       Makino D200Z (5-axis) ×1; Matsuura MX-520 (5-axis) ×2; Sodick VL600Q (Wire EDM) ×1; Zeiss Contura (CMM) ×1
  
  2. Brand + machine type when model not shown  
     - Example:  
       Engel (Injection Molding Tryout Press) ×2; Arburg (Injection Molding Tryout Press); Haas (3-axis VMC)
  
  3. Normalized categories ONLY when the site clearly lists the equipment types  
     - CNC Mills (3-axis)  
     - CNC Mills (5-axis)  
     - Wire EDM  
     - Sinker EDM  
     - Hole-Popper EDM  
     - Gun Drill  
     - Injection Molding Tryout Presses  
     - CMM / Metrology Systems  
     *ONLY use these when the site explicitly mentions these machine types.*

- ALWAYS identify any equipment from **Yasda, Makino, Kern** when visible in text or photos, even if details are sparse. These brands are high-priority and must not be skipped.

- WHAT COUNTS AS VALID EQUIPMENT (extract it):  
  • Machine lists  
  • Machine photos with visible branding (Makino, Yasda, Kern, Haas, Sodick, DMG Mori, OKK, Arburg, Engel, Zeiss)  
  • Capability pages that mention SPECIFIC machine types (CNC Mills, Wire EDM, CMM, Gun Drill, Tryout Press)  
  • PDF brochures with machine specs  
  • “Equipment List” pages  
  • “Capabilities” pages IF they mention real machine categories (not just generic “CNC machining”)

- DO NOT EXTRACT (these are NOT equipment):  
  • “CNC machining”, “EDM machining”, “precision machining”, “tooling”, “manufacturing services”  
  • “Machining centers” (without brand/type)  
  • Grinders, polishers, hand tools  
  • Software, fixtures, robots (even “automation with robot arms”)  
  • Vague phrases (“modern equipment”, “state-of-the-art machines”)

- AXIS RULE:  
  • Use (3-axis), (4-axis), (5-axis) ONLY if stated or visible on a model spec page.  

- QUANTITY RULE:  
  • Use ×qty when stated or visible (e.g., “3 Haas VF-2 machines” → Haas VF-2 (3-axis) ×3)  
  • If quantity unknown, omit ×qty.

- LAST RULE:  
  If the website has NO machine list, NO machine photos, and NO clear equipment type categories →  
     Equipment: null

Source:  
- Write the provided input source name exactly as given after “Source:”.  
- If no source was provided, write “Source: Not Sure”.

PHONE NUMBER RULES (MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS)
1) Strict priority order (stop at first valid source):  
   a. The company’s official “Contact” page on the same domain.  
   b. Website footer/header or image/PDF on the same domain.  
   c. If not listed on-site, use a trusted directory (Google Business, AMBA, or state registration) that matches the SAME company name AND SAME city/state.

2) The number must be verified as belonging to the same domain AND same region.  
   - Reject numbers whose area code does not match the company’s city/state.  
   - Example: Lafayette, LA must have an area code 337; reject area codes 254, 214, etc.

3) One main line only:  
   - Use the number labeled “Main,” “Office,” or “Call.”  
   - Prefer local line over toll-free.  
   - Do not use personal, mobile, or text-only numbers unless they are clearly the company’s primary contact.

4) Format normalization:  
   - Remove +1 or country prefix if present.  
   - U.S. format: (AAA) BBB-CCCC with optional “ ext NNNN”.  
   - Area codes must be valid U.S. codes and correspond to the state.  
   - Do not invent digits or fix typos; if invalid, mark as null.

5) Validation checks before output:  
   - Must contain exactly 10 digits (after removing +1).  
   - Must match city/state area code region.  
   - If no valid number is found after all checks, output:  
     Phone: null

Rules  
1) Primary reference = the provided domain. Supplement only when the same domain + city/state clearly match.  
2) Never mix similarly named companies from another state or different owner.  
3) Keep a professional, neutral tone with concise bullets.  
4) Always begin each record with “Row [number]”.  
5) Output plain text only (no markdown, no JSON).
